1,"It's really important to understand that when you do intermittent fasting, you need to eat a bit differently than usual.

2,"Have been experimenting w/ IF for two months, and have lost 27 lbs. Have about 33 lbs to go. 

Currently, I exercise 5 days/wk (3 gym days, 2 very light walking days, and 2 days off during fasting. 

I fast once/wk from Wed night to Fri afternoon (42 hrs). I‚Äôm roughly losing 1.5 lbs/wk now, and building muscle in the process; so‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm gaining muscle and losing fat, which is my goal. When i hit my target weight, i‚Äôll likely have to change things up with the diet. 

The fasting naturally increases testosterone, growth hormone and reduces inflammation. 

I have a 42g recovery drink 5 days/wk after workouts, a keto lunch, then i ‚Äúcheat‚Äù at dinner and eat more of what i want, tracking carbs to keep these low overall (50-75 g daily carbs).

Cut out sugars, keep carbs low, no processed food, no alcohol, no vegetable oil (just avocado and coconut oils), eat a higher fat / low carb diet, exercise and watch things improve!

IMO many folks are addicted to sugar, and will not admit this. I still have 9 g of sugar/day with my recovery drink 5 days/wk, yet have drawn the line with this amount of sugar. I just like how much protein i can get from the drink. 

Hope this helps someone!","have been experimenting w if for two months, and have lost 27 lbs. have about 33 lb to go. currently, i exercise 5 day wk (3 gym days, 2 very light walking days, and 2 day off during fasting. i fast once wk from wed night to fri afternoon (42 hrs). i m roughly losing 1.5 lb wk now, and building muscle in the process so i m gaining muscle and losing fat, which is my goal. when i hit my target weight, i ll likely have to change thing up with the diet. the fasting naturally increase testosterone, growth hormone and reduces inflammation. i have a 42g recovery drink 5 day wk after workout, a veto lunch, then i cheat at dinner and eat more of what i want, tracking car to keep these low overall (50 75 g daily cars). cut out sugars, keep car low, no processed food, no alcohol, no vegetable oil (just avocado and coconut oils), eat a higher fat low car diet, exercise and watch thing improve! i am going to many folk are addicted to sugar, and will not admit this. i still have 9 g of sugar day with my recovery drink 5 day wk, yet have drawn the line with this amount of sugar. i just like how much protein i can get from the drink. hope this help someone!",1686145712.580602,{'POSITIVE': 0.5264984965324402},miscellaneous

17,"Great video!
I wrote an article on intermittent fasting on my website for Fitness. 

As you summarize in the end of your video, one of the greatest parts, about intermittent fasting is the simple, behavioral change of cutting out late night eating. Everybody fasts at night. Choosing to ‚Äúfast‚Äù simply increases the fasting window. When someone does stick to an eating window, this usually cuts a large amount of snacking calories that people tend to eat. That, alone can create a caloric deficit and cause weight loss.

Circadian fast seems to make sense for most people on a fat loss diet. I don‚Äôt think for somebody who is starting out it would be wise to start with a short eating window. Just because it would be tough to sustain and pushing through with discipline is just a recipe for a hard rebound when the diet ends. 

For anyone, considering doing this for weight loss, I would consider starting with cutting out any late night eating, and feel free to eat a high-protein meal in the morning as you get hungry. Track your food intake and make sure you are eating high protein and healthy!

The nature of a fast of 72+ hours versus 16-18 hours a day is profound. I think this term ""intermittent fasting"" is trying to abrogate the effects of prolonged fasting to itself, but they're very different. Dr. Attia is pointing out in that podcast you played that between when the body runs out of glucose and glycogen for energy, around 18-24 hours, and when you have enough ketone metabolism to replace your daily caloric needs from your body fat, there's a period that lasts 36-48 hours or so where your body is breaking down lean tissue to make sugar to keep the organism running. It's not necessarily muscle or vital organ tissue...at least at first...but a lot of these people doing extremely narrow windows like 22:2 or one-meal-a-day or ""rolling 36s"" are essentially forcing themselves to burn lean tissue day after day after day. 

So a lot of us don't think of time-restricted feeding and intentional fasting as the same practice at all.

342,"Personal Trainer and Nutritionist Here! When working with clients, Intermittent Fasting is a great method for beginners new to nutrition and changing their eating behaviors. Food is complicated, so fasting helps us change our behavior without worrying over the specific details of each food we do eat.

Like Matt covered with Dr. Peter Attia, for fat loss, Intermittent Fasting works because of calorie deficits (eating less calories than your body burns).
-Fasting is easy to stick to and gives relatively good results because your diet will sound like this:

-Can you NOT eat breakfast or your first meal until 4-6 hours after you wake up?
-Can you go on a walk, workout, or do some exercise in that morning?
-Can you try to add 1 extra source of protein during your day after your fast?

These usually cover all the basics of a successful fat loss diet!
-Calorie Reduction
-Exercise
-Protein in your Diet

Instead of Keto, Atkins, or other fad diets, Intermittent Fasting seems to fit into most people's current lifestyles as well. This helps make dieting feel like less of a sacrifice or restriction! Unless you are diabetic and have a need to have stable glucose levels, give fasting a try and you may surprise yourself. Whatever you do find works for you, keep it up!

it's mostly just because I don't eat breakfast, and stay all day on water + coffee. It can be difficult sometimes during lunchtime, but coffee usually helps (I try to drink decaf when possible, so I don't get caffeine-induced headaches). I fast every workday, so about 4-5 times. Ideally, I'd recommend fasting 3-5 times a week... oh and I do agree on the circadian rhythm IF method is the best according to my research, but it's just not as possible with my schedule.

There are so many benefits to fasting and not snacking in general. It's the only proper way of detoxing ourselves and letting our organs rest. Extended fasts supposedly get rid of dead cells and upcycle renewal of new cells to a better extent, the latter maybe being why some associate it with cancer risk.  There's also the risk of complications such as (diabetic) ketoacidosis, but there have also been cases of diabetics having huge benefits of fasting (with or without a ketogenic diet), such as getting rid of most of their medication. 

Sure caloric restriction action, maybe a key factor to why it workforce of weight loss, but most ppl do in fact have much larger insulin spikes when breaking a fast, which is why some don't lose weight or actually gain weight instead, cus they've probably reduced metabolism over time (being highly deficient in calories) and maybe break a fast with a meal with ""high"" amount of carbs and fat. (Also more or less why some gain all their weight or more back after a specific diet)

It's all about moderation as with anything in life. Don't do things without consulting your doctor, in case you are at risk of more complications, and if you still want to do it, make sure you monitor yourself closely.
