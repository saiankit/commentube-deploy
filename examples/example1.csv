292,292,"As much as I am a fanboy of google services. I can't stand how google cheap out on the parts for their phones. Yeah I know it's a 'midrange', not a flagship. But other midrangers provide better aesthetics & thinner bezels with the same or cheaper price! What the actual fuck were you thinking with that protruding camera bar, google? As if a camera bump isn't annoying enough, you had to add a huge ass bar to the back? That's just either careless, or lazy design.

Secondly, not a huge fan of Tensor chip. If you saw through the bullshit about better 'A.I learning' with google's in-house chip, it's not. Thing runs hotter than single MILFs in my area. Other midrangers sporting 700 or even 600 series Snapdragon runs faster & cooler, with no significant impact to A.I learning. You know the only reason you're switching for an 'in-house' chip is to cut cost, stop lying to our faces Google!

Thirdly, Google Camera is really not the hot stuff anymore. There are many flagships from other companies have overtaken the google camera. With processing chips so strong these days, pictures from one phone to another is almost identical unless you compared it side-by-side, even then, the difference is still minimal & preference is subjective to individual. Post-processing can only do so much in a world of overpowered hardwares. Which is why Google no longer focuses on the flagship market, because they knew they have no place in it.

And finally, you're gonna charge 500 bucks for a bezel thicker than Sundar Pichai's eyebrows? What are we? 2010's? I can buy a 200 bucks Xiaomi/Redmi and it still have a better looking screen than this bullshit. 

Single SIM slot is also a turn off, how much space you can save with it? You remove the 2nd SIM slot and you give nothing back. I don't need motherfucking e-SIM, I want to switch SIM anytime, anywhere I want! On the fly! Not to mention the lack of headphone jack, just to sell your shitty ear buds. You're turning into Apple, Google.


So fuck you Google, fuck you sideways, up and down, over and diagonally. I'm not gonna buy your overpriced, low-cost trash until you fix your low-effort bullshit!","a much a i am a fancy of google services. i cannot stand how google cheap out on the part for their phones. yeah i know it is a 'mirage', not a flagship. but other midrangers provide better aesthetic & thinner level with the same or cheaper price! what the actual fuck were you thinking with that protruding camera bar, google a if a camera bump is not annoying enough, you had to add a huge as bar to the back that is just either careless, or lazy design. secondly, not a huge fan of tensor chip. if you saw through the bullshit about better 'a.i learning' with google's in house chip, it is not. thing run hotter than single mile in my area. other midrangers sporting 700 or even 600 series snapdragon run faster & cooler, with no significant impact to a.i learning. you know the only reason you are switching for an 'in house' chip is to cut cost, stop lying to our face google! third, google camera is really not the hot stuff anymore. there are many flagship from other company have overtaken the google camera. with processing chip so strong these days, picture from one phone to another is almost identical unless you compared it side by side, even then, the difference is still minimal & preference is subjective to individual. post processing can only do so much in a world of overpowered hardware. which is why google no longer focus on the flagship market, because they knew they have no place in it. and finally, you are going to charge 500 buck for a been thicker than sunday ficha's eyebrow what are we 2010's i can buy a 200 buck miami red and it still have a better looking screen than this bullshit. single sim slot is also a turn off, how much space you can save with it you remove the 2nd sim slot and you give nothing back. i do not need motherfucking e sim, i want to switch sim anytime, anywhere i want! on the fly! not to mention the lack of headphone jack, just to sell your shift ear buds. you are turning into apple, google. so fuck you google, fuck you sideways, up and down, over and diagonally. i am not going to buy your overpriced, low cost trash until you fix your low effort bullshit!",1684385655.152344,Negative,miscellaneous

1447,1447,"I think part of the problem with the Pixel's A phones bumping up so close to the standard one is just the release timing. I really think they need to start releasing the A phones at the same time as the others. Then it makes way more sense and sales will align more to continually maintain a price disparity between the two (rather than a $500 A phone vs a $500 standard phone on sale). As it stands, the standard phone is always halfway through its cycle and is pretty much always on significant sales, so the $100 price difference is misleading - they'll be the same price. On top of that, even the Pro phones get significant discounts at this point in the lifecycle (you can find the 128 GB Pixel 7 Pro for just $650 USD at Best Buy as of writing this comment) so you're really only getting ""savings"" if you're specifically buying from the Google Store. If they released at the same time though, you might see sales on all three simultaneously - so something like $350 - $400 for the A, $500 for the standard, and $650 for the Pro. As it stands, the A phones feel like they don't really have a place in the lineup when they release.

I assume they specifically don't do this in order to avoid cannibalizing the more expensive phones when they're in their prime window and to get a mid-year sales bump, but to me it feels so bizarre to have this mid-lifecycle release of the smaller, lower price Pixel rather than having it be with the others.","i think part of the problem with the pixel's a phone bumping up so close to the standard one is just the release timing. i really think they need to start releasing the a phone at the same time a the others. then it make way more sense and sale will align more to continually maintain a price disparity between the two (rather than a $500 a phone v a $500 standard phone on sale). a it stands, the standard phone is always halfway through it cycle and is pretty much always on significant sales, so the $100 price difference is misleading they will be the same price. on top of that, even the pro phone get significant discount at this point in the lifecycle (you can find the 128 gb pixel 7 pro for just $650 usd at best buy a of writing this comment) so you are really only getting saving if you are specifically buying from the google store. if they released at the same time though, you might see sale on all three simultaneously so something like $350 $400 for the a, $500 for the standard, and $650 for the pro. a it stands, the a phone feel like they do not really have a place in the lineup when they release. i assume they specifically do not do this in order to avoid cannibalizing the more expensive phone when they are in their prime window and to get a mid year sale bump, but to me it feel so bizarre to have this mid lifecycle release of the smaller, lower price pixel rather than having it be with the others.",1683780886.287431,Neutral,miscellaneous
