The fasting naturally increases testosterone, growth hormone and reduces inflammation. 

I have a 42g recovery drink 5 days/wk after workouts, a keto lunch, then i ‚Äúcheat‚Äù at dinner and eat more of what i want, tracking carbs to keep these low overall (50-75 g daily carbs).

Cut out sugars, keep carbs low, no processed food, no alcohol, no vegetable oil (just avocado and coconut oils), eat a higher fat / low carb diet, exercise and watch things improve!

IMO many folks are addicted to sugar, and will not admit this. I still have 9 g of sugar/day with my recovery drink 5 days/wk, yet have drawn the line with this amount of sugar. I just like how much protein i can get from the drink.

17,17,"Great video!
I wrote an article on intermittent fasting on my website for Fitness. 

As you summarize in the end of your video, one of the greatest parts, about intermittent fasting is the simple, behavioral change of cutting out late night eating. Everybody fasts at night. Choosing to ‚Äúfast‚Äù simply increases the fasting window. When someone does stick to an eating window, this usually cuts a large amount of snacking calories that people tend to eat. That, alone can create a caloric deficit and cause weight loss.

Circadian fast seems to make sense for most people on a fat loss diet. I don‚Äôt think for somebody who is starting out it would be wise to start with a short eating window. Just because it would be tough to sustain and pushing through with discipline is just a recipe for a hard rebound when the diet ends. 

For anyone, considering doing this for weight loss, I would consider starting with cutting out any late night eating, and feel free to eat a high-protein meal in the morning as you get hungry. Track your food intake and make sure you are eating high protein and healthy!

The nature of a fast of 72+ hours versus 16-18 hours a day is profound. I think this term ""intermittent fasting"" is trying to abrogate the effects of prolonged fasting to itself, but they're very different. Dr. Attia is pointing out in that podcast you played that between when the body runs out of glucose and glycogen for energy, around 18-24 hours, and when you have enough ketone metabolism to replace your daily caloric needs from your body fat, there's a period that lasts 36-48 hours or so where your body is breaking down lean tissue to make sugar to keep the organism running. It's not necessarily muscle or vital organ tissue...at least at first...but a lot of these people doing extremely narrow windows like 22:2 or one-meal-a-day or ""rolling 36s"" are essentially forcing themselves to burn lean tissue day after day after day. 

So a lot of us don't think of time-restricted feeding and intentional fasting as the same practice at all. For me, a real fast begins at 72 hours without calories and builds from there, after the body has entered a state of protein conservation and is getting its full energy requirement from body fat.","i prefer the term time restricted feeding for this strategy. i do prolonged fasting a few time a year for up to 7 days. the nature of a fast of 72+ hour versus 16 18 hour a day is profound. i think this term intermittent fasting is trying to abrogate the effect of prolonged fasting to itself, but they are very different. dr. attic is pointing out in that podcast you played that between when the body run out of glucose and glycogen for energy, around 18 24 hours, and when you have enough ketone metabolism to replace your daily calorie need from your body fat, there is a period that last 36 48 hour or so where your body is breaking down lean tissue to make sugar to keep the organism running. it is not necessarily muscle or vital organ tissue.at least at first.but a lot of these people doing extremely narrow window like or one meal a day or rolling 36s are essentially forcing themselves to burn lean tissue day after day after day. so a lot of u do not think of time restricted feeding and intentional fasting a the same practice at all. for me, a real fast begin at 72 hour without calorie and build from there, after the body ha entered a state of protein conservation and is getting it full energy requirement from body fat.",1685004520.811892,Neutral,miscellaneous

325,325,"Yes. There is so much to say about this topic that a clickbait 30-day challenge video without any context could confuse more than it illuminates. Case in point: Dr. Attia being taken out of context in saying that he has been convinced that the benefits of intermittent fasting/time-restricted feeding are just calorie reduction. He does believe that ABOUT TIME-RESTRICTED FEEDING, but that's not to say that he sees no benefit to the practice and is misleading as a summary of his views on fasting for health. Nor is it good reasoning to ""argue from authority"" by citing a popular personality's opinion on the matter without formulating a cogent argument that can be falsified on its own terms.

The point that you make about insulin is vital, because fasting is unique in that it can put you into a state of low blood glucose and low blood insulin at the same time.

342,342,"Personal Trainer and Nutritionist Here! When working with clients, Intermittent Fasting is a great method for beginners new to nutrition and changing their eating behaviors. Food is complicated, so fasting helps us change our behavior without worrying over the specific details of each food we do eat.

Like Matt covered with Dr. Peter Attia, for fat loss, Intermittent Fasting works because of calorie deficits (eating less calories than your body burns).
-Fasting is easy to stick to and gives relatively good results because your diet will sound like this:

-Can you NOT eat breakfast or your first meal until 4-6 hours after you wake up?
-Can you go on a walk, workout, or do some exercise in that morning?
-Can you try to add 1 extra source of protein during your day after your fast?

These usually cover all the basics of a successful fat loss diet!
-Calorie Reduction
-Exercise
-Protein in your Diet

Instead of Keto, Atkins, or other fad diets, Intermittent Fasting seems to fit into most people's current lifestyles as well. This helps make dieting feel like less of a sacrifice or restriction! Unless you are diabetic and have a need to have stable glucose levels, give fasting a try and you may surprise yourself. Whatever you do find works for you, keep it up! Y'all got this :D","personal trainer and nutritionist here! when working with clients, intermittent fasting is a great method for beginner new to nutrition and changing their eating behaviors. food is complicated, so fasting help u change our behavior without worrying over the specific detail of each food we do eat. like matt covered with dr. peter attic, for fat loss, intermittent fasting work because of calorie deficit (eating le calorie than your body burns). fasting is easy to stick to and give relatively good result because your diet will sound like this: can you not eat breakfast or your first meal until 4 6 hour after you wake up can you go on a walk, workout, or do some exercise in that morning can you try to add 1 extra source of protein during your day after your fast these usually cover all the basic of a successful fat loss diet! calorie reduction exercise protein in your diet instead of veto, watkins, or other fad diets, intermittent fasting seems to fit into most people's current lifestyle a well. this help make editing feel like le of a sacrifice or restriction! unless you are diabetic and have a need to have stable glucose levels, give fasting a try and you may surprise yourself. whatever you do find work for you, keep it up! you all got this",1685004521.290614,Positive,miscellaneous

it's mostly just because I don't eat breakfast, and stay all day on water + coffee.

Ideally, I'd recommend fasting 3-5 times a week... oh and I do agree on the circadian rhythm IF method is the best according to my research, but it's just not as possible with my schedule.

There are so many benefits to fasting and not snacking in general. It's the only proper way of detoxing ourselves and letting our organs rest. Extended fasts supposedly get rid of dead cells and upcycle renewal of new cells to a better extent, the latter maybe being why some associate it with cancer risk.  There's also the risk of complications such as (diabetic) ketoacidosis, but there have also been cases of diabetics having huge benefits of fasting (with or without a ketogenic diet), such as getting rid of most of their medication. 

Sure caloric restriction action, maybe a key factor to why it workforce of weight loss, but most ppl do in fact have much larger insulin spikes when breaking a fast, which is why some don't lose weight or actually gain weight instead, cus they've probably reduced metabolism over time (being highly deficient in calories) and maybe break a fast with a meal with ""high"" amount of carbs and fat. (Also more or less why some gain all their weight or more back after a specific diet)

It's all about moderation as with anything in life. Don't do things without consulting your doctor, in case you are at risk of more complications, and if you still want to do it, make sure you monitor yourself closely.

570,570,¬†@Jimmy¬† Congrats man hope you achieve your desired weight. Im in the U.S so sunrise during ramadan was at 5:30ish and sunset was around 8pm. This is between 14 and 15 hours. Maybe you do need that 16 hours though as you mentioned to start really burning fat im not sure.
