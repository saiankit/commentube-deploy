In the 1980s we slowly moved to WIMP (Windows, Icons Menus, Pointers). The Mouse became the primery input paradigm. Mac, Windows, Amiga, ST, Archimedies.

The iPhone/iPad switched us to touch displays. Laptops/desktops are still around. But I bet most people, outside a work/education environment, do 90% of their computing on a Phone/Tablet.

Music, video, photography, web browsing, email, gaming, etc. I bet phone/text is the least used function of most Smartphones.

Which brings us to the Vision Pro. The next paradigm shift in computing. Essentially keyboard to mouse to touch to (largely) voice (Siri AI probably more important here than AR itself), but certainly combined with a virtual mixed reality display and the eye tracking.

The only people who actually bought the Google Glass were celebrities, and sometimes celebrities were given them for free because, duh, they are celebrities. Popular celebrities. It’s good for business.

In the end no one ended up buying it and today it’s only used for commercial purposes, not for consumers.

I will reply to this comment to address other arguments people have brought up because this comment is getting long.","when i see the apple vision pro, i am immediately reminded of the google glass. how it failed a few year ago. anyways, if you are not aware, google glass wa this piece of tech designed by google which allowed a mobile phone to be even more portable, a it wa embedded into prescription glass which you could take everywhere. it wa only $10, and if a piece of tech at $10 failed, just imagine what a piece of tech which cost $3,500 today would do. the only people who actually bought the google glass were celebrities, and sometimes celebrity were given them for free because, duh, they are celebrities. popular celebrities. it s good for business. in the end no one ended up buying it and today it s only used for commercial purposes, not for consumers. i will reply to this comment to address other argument people have brought up because this comment is getting long.",1686207301.655771,miscellaneous,Neutral

404,404,"Somehow, I disagree with the arguments that this wouldn't be general uses. 

Likely many wouldn't buy a upper end MacBook Pro or iMac but an in-expensive one. This Vision Pro could do a lot serious stuff.

Even iPad Pro might be canibolised in sales. Cheaper iPad might be what people have with Vision Pro.

(There is a virtual keyboard, so there likely will be virtual Apple Pen too.  The 12 cameras and etc are there, it seems, not just to pick up the ambient features. They do look and analyse your hand and fingers. Hence virtual keyboard and virtual Apple Pen are there I am sure.)

The knob is there to adjust the 3 lense in relation to one another to get your picked screen in the distance you like without other screens and ambient features become blurry. This technology was, I believe, first time, used in cinema, in one of Sharon Stone's western film with Russel Crowe when he first went to Hollywood about 30 years ago.

The creepy eye looks perhaps would be changed later. FaceTime isn't always about pleasant interactions. A smile face when the other party is in sorrow wouldn't be appropriate.

TV companies must be worried. Many wouldn't upgrade their large TV if indeed Vision Pro could give better viewing experiences. I am sure, btw, sharing the same DVD film with others (with their own Vision Pro) in Vision Pro is easily done. Each of people have their own preferred experience in term of screen sizes and sound patterns, etc. 

Apple gets its sales and profits from the general users. Specialists and businesses aren't the main focus for Apple. (Or Apple would've taken over IBM by now) Likely once people could get their hand on trial, many would delay replacing their Mac and iPad as well as LED 4k tv for a while and save money to get Vision Pro or cheaper and improved version of it in future. 

One observation. Those with prescription glasses, I believe, need to get adjust lenses fitted specifically for Vision Pro. That would be a pain for many .. Most don't have 20/20 vision at all... Hopefully this process isn't too expensive. 

Two last observations.

Google Glass wouldn't be like this at all. The camera and microphone number and the need for 3 lenses to move virtual screens and the internal cameras to lock up your eye movements to focus on specific points on virtual screens simply make the Google Glass nothing but rubbish in comparison. It's a totally different technology level altogether and uses too. 

The R1 chip is proprietary as with the M chip. Somehow, we don't have other known competition for R chip. That would make competitions catching up very difficult for many years. 

Apple might be a later comer to the party. But what an entrance that has deep and real substance.

411,411,"The only 'criticism' that I'm hearing from reviewers is the weight.
It is of course, less heavy than other headsets currently on the market (except for some new concept designs like the Bigscreen Beyond, et al), but it is still a lot of tech sitting on your face.
Since it is tethered to a power supply, I have to wonder if any other tech, like the processors & sensors, bluetooth could not be moved out of the headpiece and into a secondary unit, perhaps worn around the neck (so that the movement capture is still within range of the eyes), with a short data cable running between the two.
The collar piece could also attach to some (after market) haptic elements like a vest, gloves or leg tracking modules (via bluetooth). This unit might also have speakers, instead of headphones to allow peripheral sounds to mingle with those coming through the VR interface (headphones could still be used where privacy is required).

With the rise of ChatGPT, think how slow humans will be at learning if they don’t use AI. Or slower. So for people concerned at the rise of AI it makes sense to consider augments. I’m already used to it and no human has perfect or amazing physicality or accuracy. Humans are amazing at learning and adapting and guessing not accurately so much as audaciously and ambitiously. Our natural senses are all impaired compared to other animals. We might like to think hey good enough. Then our continuous tech leaps move forward and extend our reach yet again.

I have lived my whole life with augmentation layered on my natural state of severe sensorineural hearing loss. Some deaf people prefer that. This is similar.

1. I think VR headsets need to super light and large FOV, and low latency, and all the visuals need to be wirelessly sent. The level of graphics required non poly or flat experience is huge. I might of been impressed if they ran Half life 2 in their demo .
2. Head strap is poor design we need something like a welding helmet that can flip up and down quickly. Passthrough is not going to solve VR eye fatigue. VR is best used in 10-30 min bursts of immersion. 
3. Eye tracking is key for Foveated rendering for performance (good on apple for investing in this)
4. compelling content to fit the 10-30 min burst use-case.
5. Tactile controllers. I don't think hand tracking works well even when responsive your hards are looking for some level of tactile feedback and when hand tracking fails it breaks immersion. Hand tacking is nice in a pinch but 1:1 controllers offers a superior experience.   +1 for good haptics.

The Vision Pro is literally packed with industry-level tech that in execution outmatches everything else in existence in the AR and VR space, and AR/VR solutions that even come close to this caliber are all over 5000 dollars. That says a lot lol. 

This device is innovative because it is pushing more advanced tech (industry level stuff) into a package that FOR ONE is portable, which in it of itself is a wonder because of the sheer amount of power inside, and TWO... is more affordable to the general population than any other vr headset in it's calber is by a longshot. Its vastly more advanced than something like the Meta Quest Pro, and, while it is (significantly) more expensive, it is paving the way for future technology in this space to be more affordable as time goes on.

You'd think before dropping $3500 or more on a toy, they'd try the cheaper toy first to see if it's even worth it or has any staying power.  Many people buy the Quest and within a short time are already bored with it.  Some aren't but many are.  I can easily see a lot of people dropping $3500 on it and then not using it for long and then cry their regrets.  What a waste!  The same people who scoffed at the Quest are the same ones drewling over the Vision Pro.  Nonsense.  Why not wait and see what others do?  If it has staying power and you've tried cheaper headsets, then jump in both feet?  Like look before you leap?  I mean I like the Quest but I only use it occasionally.  Meta has had problems trying to sell their more expensive pro unit.  Apple sheep just want it to tell everyone theirs is better.  OK, great, plop that money down and tell everyone you got your superior headset if that's what it's all about.  Really tho, is it worth it?  You won't be using it as a computer monitor.  Tried that on a quest and it's just too uncomfortable to use it for that for long.  The Quest 3 is supposed to be lighter so that might help but still I doubt it would be light enough for that.  If Vision is even heavier then that's boo boo.  If the Vision were closer to the Quest's price I might consider it but at 10x the price, wow that's rediculous for consumer level.  Content is king also and Quest has that.  Other headsets are close but they are struggling with that.  So far it looks like Vision has not much content.  The Steam VR app might help but the great yet exclusive games are on Quest for the most part.  Surely Vision will have some exclusive titles too to try to pry people to their platform.  Sigh.  I hate exclusives.  For me the price and the heavy uncomfortableness of it and the lack of content are nonstarters for me.  shrug.","there are a lot of strange people in this world. you would think before dropping $3500 or more on a toy, they would try the cheaper toy first to see if it is even worth it or ha any staying power. many people buy the quest and within a short time are already bored with it. some are not but many are. i can easily see a lot of people dropping $3500 on it and then not using it for long and then cry their regrets. what a waste! the same people who scored at the quest are the same one drawing over the vision pro. nonsense. why not wait and see what others do if it ha staying power and you have tried cheaper headset, then jump in both foot like look before you leap i mean i like the quest but i only use it occasionally. meta ha had problem trying to sell their more expensive pro unit. apple sheep just want it to tell everyone theirs is better. ok, great, pop that money down and tell everyone you got your superior headset if that is what it is all about. really though, is it worth it you will not be using it a a computer monitor. tried that on a quest and it is just too uncomfortable to use it for that for long. the quest 3 is supposed to be lighter so that might help but still i doubt it would be light enough for that. if vision is even heavier then that is boo boo. if the vision were closer to the quest's price i might consider it but at 10x the price, wow that is ridiculous for consumer level. content is king also and quest ha that. other headset are close but they are struggling with that. so far it look like vision ha not much content. the steam vr app might help but the great yet exclusive game are on quest for the most part. surely vision will have some exclusive title too to try to try people to their platform. sigh. i hate exclusives. for me the price and the heavy uncomfortableness of it and the lack of content are nonstarter for me. shrub.",1686178522.49203,miscellaneous,Negative

Do not steal.
Do not commit adultery.
Do not insult God by using his name as a cuss word.

That can grow because of this new product line, if it gets more afford- or desireable, but it will not conquer the world like Android of Windows did. Why?

1939,1939,"The iPhone was basically the next evolution of the iPod, which was a device that was already wildly popular because it performed a function that most people want: being able to play digital music on the go. Yes, the touchscreen interface was rather revolutionary, but people who didn't know how it functioned weren't sold on it just by watching someone swipe at a screen... they were sold on it by the functionality that it provided, a lot of which was replacing devices that people were already using. The iPhone successfully consolidated many pieces of technology into a small, modern form factor.

A VR/AR headset doesn't replace anything, it adds an additional obstacle to basic use (strapping on a bulky headset with an additional tethered battery and sacrificing HEAVILY on battery power). Maybe it's just because I've been absolutely nuts about VR since the early 90's, back when it really sucked, but owning modern VR devices has made it abundantly clear to me that the average person does not want to regularly strap a bulky headset to their face just to do basic tasks, and yes, this is still very much a bulky headset. Anything larger and heavier than a pair of sunglasses will never reach mass adoption regardless of how good the software is. And even if they dropped the price to bargain bin levels (like $100), they might sell the thing to everyone, but most people will stop using it after a short period of time because of the hassle of strapping on a headset.

The idea that this is the next iPhone is patently absurd. The iPhone was a mass market device: it was priced well, and it served several needs for the average user. This does neither. It's an answer in search of a question. Yes, we're still at that point in VR, and I haven't even bothered to point out the massive increase in development costs for anyone desiring to create software for this thing. Can you stomach 10 times the development time for software that only a fraction of your normal user base will use? Probably not. Without software support, this goes nowhere.

Luckily, it's an Apple product, so people will support it, but that doesn't mean it'll be a mainstream success, and clearly Apple knows this. That's why the price is so high. This isn't a product for the average consumer. So on that point alone, it fails to be ""the next iPhone.""","the iphone wa basically the next evolution of the ipod, which wa a device that wa already wildly popular because it performed a function that most people want: being able to play digital music on the go. yes, the touchscreen interface wa rather revolutionary, but people who did not know how it functioned were not sold on it just by watching someone swine at a screen. they were sold on it by the functionality that it provided, a lot of which wa replacing device that people were already using. the iphone successfully consolidated many piece of technology into a small, modern form factor. a vr ar headset doe not replace anything, it add an additional obstacle to basic use (trapping on a bulky headset with an additional gathered battery and sacrificing heavily on battery power). maybe it is just because i have been absolutely nut about vr since the early 90's, back when it really sucked, but owning modern vr device ha made it abundantly clear to me that the average person doe not want to regularly strap a bulky headset to their face just to do basic tasks, and yes, this is still very much a bulky headset. anything larger and heavier than a pair of sunglass will never reach mass adoption regardless of how good the software is. and even if they dropped the price to bargain bin level (like $100), they might sell the thing to everyone, but most people will stop using it after a short period of time because of the hassle of trapping on a headset. the idea that this is the next iphone is patently absurd. the iphone wa a mass market device: it wa priced well, and it served several need for the average user. this doe neither. it is an answer in search of a question. yes, we are still at that point in vr, and i have not even bothered to point out the massive increase in development cost for anyone desiring to create software for this thing. can you stomach 10 time the development time for software that only a fraction of your normal user base will use probably not. without software support, this go nowhere. lucky, it is an apple product, so people will support it, but that doe not mean it will be a mainstream success, and clearly apple know this. that is why the price is so high. this is not a product for the average consumer. so on that point alone, it fails to be the next iphone.",1686174950.932946,miscellaneous,Negative

The 1st gen iPhone wasn’t even a 3G device, had no App Store at launch, and didn’t support MMS, ffs😂
