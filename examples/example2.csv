A battle within, where insecurity hides,
For my crown once adorned with lustrous strands,
Now reveals a truth I struggle to understand.

Hair, like autumn leaves, began to wane,
Vanishing slowly, leaving an empty terrain,
And I, a man lost in this fleeting guise,
Yearning for the solace of youthful guise.

Each mirror's reflection, a piercing sting,
The fading echoes of what once was king,
But as I tread this path, somber and long,
A revelation emerges, a harmonious song.

For in the eyes of others, I find no disdain,
No judgement, no pity, no whispered refrain,
They see not the absence of strands on my head,
But the essence within, where true beauty's thread.

My worth lies not in tresses or flowing locks,
But in the stories I carry, the wisdom that talks,
Each wrinkle, each line, etched upon my face,
A testament to a journey I've come to embrace.

As time weaves its tapestry, vibrant and bold,
I begin to see truths, previously untold,
That my hair was a cloak, a mask I once wore,
And its loss, a catalyst, an open door.

No longer bound by strands that once defined,
I'm free to explore the depths of my mind,
To unravel the layers of who I can be,
Beyond the confines of society's decree.

In this revelation, sadness transforms to glee,
For the shackles of hair loss are broken, set free,
The burden I carried, a weight now released,
As I stand tall, radiant, my spirit unceased.

No more will I be captive to whispers unkind,
For my true beauty lies in the depths of my mind,
And those who truly see me, they understand,
That my hair loss was just a challenge, life's demand.

So, I raise my head, no longer in despair,
Embracing the journey, a newfound flair,
For I am still me, in all my imperfect grace,
Hair loss a mere chapter in life's intricate maze.

Sadness turns to joy, in this transformative tale,
A celebration of self, where doubts now pale,
For I am more than the strands that have fallen,
A man of substance, resilience, standing tall and unbroken.","in the depth of my soul, a sorrow resides, a battle within, where insecurity hides, for my crown once adorned with lustrous strands, now reveals a truth i struggle to understand. hair, like autumn leaves, began to wane, vanishing slowly, leaving an empty terrain, and i, a man lost in this fleeting guise, yearning for the solace of youthful guise. each mirror's reflection, a piercing sting, the fading echo of what once wa king, but a i tread this path, somber and long, a revelation emerges, a harmonious song. for in the eye of others, i find no disdain, no judgement, no pity, no whisper refrain, they see not the absence of strand on my head, but the essence within, where true beauty's thread. my worth lie not in dress or flowing locks, but in the story i carry, the wisdom that talks, each twinkle, each line, etched upon my face, a testament to a journey i have come to embrace. a time weave it tapestry, vibrant and bold, i begin to see truths, previously untold, that my hair wa a cloak, a mask i once wore, and it loss, a catalyst, an open door. no longer bound by strand that once defined, i am free to explore the depth of my mind, to unravel the layer of who i can be, beyond the confines of society's decree. in this revelation, sadness transforms to glee, for the tackle of hair loss are broken, set free, the burden i carried, a weight now released, a i stand tall, radiant, my spirit increased. no more will i be captive to whisper kind, for my true beauty lie in the depth of my mind, and those who truly see me, they understand, that my hair loss wa just a challenge, life's demand. so, i raise my head, no longer in despair, embracing the journey, a newfound flair, for i am still me, in all my imperfect grace, hair loss a mere chapter in life's intricate maze. sadness turn to joy, in this transformative tale, a celebration of self, where doubt now pale, for i am more than the strand that have fallen, a man of substance, resilience, standing tall and unbroken.",1685349021.794292,miscellaneous,Neutral

65,65,"That‚Äôs right it can lower blood pressure but since we‚Äôre talking about hair loss what is your point? I am saying the mechanism of action by which hair growth is experienced using minoxidil is not a result of increased blood flow. It‚Äôs okay since you appear to be so simple minded let me explain it to you: 

There is a prevalent theory that blood flow to the scalp is linked to hair growth and that medications like minoxidil, a hypertensive medication, work by promoting this blood flow. While it's true that minoxidil can increase blood flow, there are numerous misconceptions about how it promotes hair growth and whether blood flow is a causal factor in baldness.

Moreover, if the primary cause of hair loss were inadequate blood flow, we would expect other blood pressure medications to have similar effects on hair growth. However, this is not the case. Only minoxidil among the anti-hypertensive medications has been found to have a significant effect on hair growth. This suggests that it's the unique properties of minoxidil, rather than its effect on blood flow per se, that are beneficial for hair growth.

The idea that reduced blood flow is a major cause of baldness is largely based on the observation that balding areas of the scalp often have fewer and smaller blood vessels. But research suggests that this is likely a consequence, rather than a cause, of hair loss. When a hair follicle miniaturizes and eventually dies, which is a primary characteristic of androgenetic alopecia (common baldness), the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) that supply it also regress. So, it's more likely that the reduction in blood flow is a result of hair follicle death, rather than the other way around.

Further evidence comes from research on hair transplants. When hair follicles from a non-balding area are transplanted to a balding area, they continue to grow normally despite the supposedly inadequate blood flow in the balding area. This supports the idea that it's the health and genetic programming of the individual hair follicles, rather than the overall blood flow to the scalp, that primarily determines whether hair grows or not.

To summarize, the theory that blood flow is a primary determinant of hair growth is largely a myth. While minoxidil does have vasodilatory properties, it's unlikely that this is the primary mechanism by which it promotes hair growth. Furthermore, reduced blood flow in balding areas appears to be a consequence, rather than a cause, of hair loss. The primary causes of hair loss are thought to be hormonal (e.g., dihydrotestosterone in male pattern baldness) and genetic, with research ongoing to understand the full complexities of these processes.","that s right it can lower blood pressure but since we re talking about hair loss what is your point i am saying the mechanism of action by which hair growth is experienced using minoxidil is not a result of increased blood flow. it s okay since you appear to be so simple minded let me explain it to you: there is a prevalent theory that blood flow to the scalp is linked to hair growth and that medication like minoxidil, a hypertension medication, work by promoting this blood flow. while it is true that minoxidil can increase blood flow, there are numerous misconception about how it promotes hair growth and whether blood flow is a causal factor in madness. moreover, if the primary because of hair loss were inadequate blood flow, we would expect other blood pressure medication to have similar effect on hair growth. however, this is not the case. only minoxidil among the anti hypertension medication ha been found to have a significant effect on hair growth. this suggests that it is the unique property of minoxidil, rather than it effect on blood flow per se, that are beneficial for hair growth. the idea that reduced blood flow is a major because of madness is largely based on the observation that bolding area of the scalp often have fewer and smaller blood vessels. but research suggests that this is likely a consequence, rather than a because, of hair loss. when a hair follicle miniature and eventually dies, which is a primary characteristic of androgenetic alopecia (common madness), the tiny blood vessel (capillaries) that supply it also regrets. so, it is more likely that the reduction in blood flow is a result of hair follicle death, rather than the other way around. further evidence come from research on hair transplants. when hair follicle from a non bolding area are transplanted to a bolding area, they continue to grow normally despite the supposedly inadequate blood flow in the bolding area. this support the idea that it is the health and genetic programming of the individual hair follicle, rather than the overall blood flow to the scalp, that primarily determines whether hair grows or not. to summarize, the theory that blood flow is a primary determinant of hair growth is largely a myth. while minoxidil doe have vasodilatory properties, it is unlikely that this is the primary mechanism by which it promotes hair growth. furthermore, reduced blood flow in bolding area appears to be a consequence, rather than a because, of hair loss. the primary cause of hair loss are thought to be hormonal (e.g., dihydrotestosterone in male pattern madness) and genetic, with research ongoing to understand the full complexity of these processes.",1685262622.358738,miscellaneous,Neutral

Having said that, I find it hard to believe that .25mg of topical finasteride would be the equivalent of 2.5mg taken orally.

140,140,"Here are the notes I took while watching this, mostly about the treatments, not as much the science. This is not thorough! Only sharing in case it helps anyone else.

- 34:36 - inhibiting dihydrotestosterone (DHT) can support preservation of hair and regrowth of lost hair
- 37:47 - minoxidil (rogaine) allows more bloodflow, extends anogen phase. slows new hair loss. Start with the lowest possible dose - oral 0.25 mg
- 47:58 - tadalafil 2.5-5mg (cialis) to increase bloodflow to the scalp to slow rates of hair loss
- 49:23 - PRP platelet rich plasma, injection of your own blood into the scalp. expensive and hit or miss
- 52:43 - microneedling 2.5-5mm. good augment for the hormonal therapies. increases inflammation to motivate stem cells. Combining with Minoxidil can recover dead zones
- 1:02:00 - botox. temporary, need to keep injecting
- 1:04:55 - low dose tadalafil (cialis) doesn't have the side effects of minoxidil, and you don't have to keep taking
- 1:17:00 - topical caffeine as effective as minoxidil without the side effects. apply 3-5x weekly. can maintain hair and somewhat grow new
- 1:21:14 - the most direct way to increase hair growth is to increase IGF-1 (insulin growth factor). Can get prescription growth hormone and IGF-1. Naturally released during first 2 hours of sleep. Should sleep same time daily. Sermorelin is a peptide that increases IGF-1.
- 1:24:46 - myoinositol supplement 900mg to make you less insulin resistant and increase your IGF-1. Take it before bed. Or berberine. Or metformin (prescription)
- 1:25:57 - need sufficient iron. Women should have 25-100. Men 30-150. Get a blood test. Supplements if too low. Iron plays a key role in anigen phase of hair growth.
- 1:28:08 - anything that reduces alpha reductase, is going to reduce DHT, is going to extend the anigen (growth) phase and offset the tilagen (removal) phase of hair. Saw palmetto will mildly reduce alpha reductase. Few side effects. 300 mg/day, taken at 100/mg 3x a day.
- 1:32:00 - circumin in some ppl can inhibit 5-alpha-reductase and DHT. 1-2gram capsules is a high dosage
- 1:33:29 - ketoconazole. Nizoral shampoo. Antifungal that can increase hair number and thickness. Mild DHT reduction. Use 2-4x per week, on scalp for 3-5 min, 80% response rate of maintaining hair that would otherwise be lost. Shampoo should be 2% or higher in concentration of ketoconazole. See links in description.
- 1:39:12 - finasteride (propecia) treatment. Reduces DHT, can increase hair count by 20%. Can reduce hair loss in 90% of ppl that take it. Increase hair thickness by 20-30%. Significant sexual side effects- trail and error. Topical is 1% ointment rubbed into head, equivalent to 1 mg oral. Topical harder to dose. 0.5-1mg oral.
- 1:56:18 - dutasteride similar to finasteride. 0.5-2.5 mg orally daily works 2-5x faster than finasteride at inducing hair regrowth, and reduces DHT levels by 95%. Side effects in DHT pathway: sex drive reduction, overall drive, increases estrogen, breast tissue
- 1:58:07 - to mildly inhibit DHT: saw palmetto, topical caffeine, ketoconazole. Potent stimulus: finasteride. 
- 1:59:08 - combination treatments that involve a mechanical stimulus and a chemical stimulus always better together than alone. most effective mechanical: microneedling. most effective chemical: finasteride.

1. Fragrance free shampoo. Korean cosmetic industry understand why years ago, we are still behind. So get any good paraben free shampoo, even baby shampoo that is tear free is that. 

2. Taoist soap for hair growth 2x a week only: stops further loss, stimulates new growth. 

3. Nettle tea to drink 2x a day at least for removing hormone residue in the liver, further supporting hormone balance, altho not fully but enough. 

4. Scalp massage for 30 minutes a day. Do not skip, just massage with your finger tips slow and hard, be gentle at first as next day can get sore. 

5. Collagen powder 2x a day w tablespoons each time. Don't get pills they are not high dose enough. 

6. Cold water rinse on just top of scalp, don't let cold water on back of neck or head much as you might get sick. But once a day or a couple times a week does wonders.

153,153,"I would like to share my little story of hairloss. My hair began to fade around age of 15, due to stress and probably genetics. It was devastating for me. Imagine being teenager that loses a lot of hair with each shower. At the time I tried to stop hairloss by all means. I went to many specialists and tried many treatments. For about a year or two I was using only minoxidil. It slowed whole process, but wasn't enough though. My hair still got thinner and thinner. Around age of 17 dermatologist prescribed finasterid. It finally helped. Treatment, altough successfull, was quite costly, but my parents supported me a lot. Around the age of 18 I went to cardiologist, due to slightly elevated blood pressure. After I told him I had been taking finasterid for a while he looked me dead in the eyes and with compassion told me that those meds may halt hairloss, but won't reverse it and will work only as long as taken. He also mentioned that side effects can be quite severe for such a young person and I better get used to being bald sonner or later. He said sth like ""taking finasterid is like chemical castration"". That day I decided to stop finasterid and stick to minoxidil, but now for long. After dumping minoxidil I lost most scalp hair almost imidiately. It was like those little guys only were waiting for that day with packed belongings XD. By the age of 20 my hair on scalp didn't grow at all and I was forced to either shave it or trim to like 1mm every few days.

Now I'm 22 and I kinda like my bald head. I like to make a lot of jokes about that and people seem to like it. I look waaaay older than my age.

527,527,"Here are some of the key points from Andrew Huberman on hair regrowth and how to halt hair fall 
1. Hair growth is largely determined by genetics, but lifestyle factors such as diet, stress, and sleep can also play a role.
2. Hair loss can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, hormonal changes, and autoimmune disorders.
3. The most effective treatments for hair loss are those that target the underlying cause, such as medications or hormone therapy.
4. Hair growth supplements such as biotin and collagen may help improve the health of hair, but their effectiveness is not well-supported by scientific research.
5. Topical treatments such as minoxidil (Rogaine) can help stimulate hair growth, but must be used consistently and can have side effects.
6. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has been shown to improve hair growth in some studies, but its effectiveness may vary depending on the individual.
7. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy involves injecting a patient's own platelet-rich plasma into the scalp to stimulate hair growth. While some studies have shown promising results, more research is needed to determine its effectiveness.
8. Hair transplantation is a surgical procedure that involves moving hair follicles from one area of the scalp to another. It can be an effective solution for certain types of hair loss, but is not suitable for everyone.
9. Lifestyle changes such as reducing stress, getting enough sleep, and eating a healthy diet can help improve the health of hair and reduce hair loss.","here are some of the key point from andrew superman on hair growth and how to halt hair fall 1. hair growth is largely determined by genetics, but lifestyle factor such a diet, stress, and sleep can also play a role. 2. hair loss can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, hormonal changes, and autoimmune disorders. 3. the most effective treatment for hair loss are those that target the underlying because, such a medication or hormone therapy. 4. hair growth supplement such a violin and collagen may help improve the health of hair, but their effectiveness is not well supported by scientific research. 5. topical treatment such a minoxidil (routine) can help stimulate hair growth, but must be used consistently and can have side effects. 6. low level laser therapy (llt) ha been shown to improve hair growth in some studies, but it effectiveness may vary depending on the individual. 7. platelet rich plasma (pp) therapy involves injecting a patient's own platelet rich plasma into the scalp to stimulate hair growth. while some study have shown promising results, more research is needed to determine it effectiveness. 8. hair transplantation is a surgical procedure that involves moving hair follicle from one area of the scalp to another. it can be an effective solution for certain type of hair loss, but is not suitable for everyone. 9. lifestyle change such a reducing stress, getting enough sleep, and eating a healthy diet can help improve the health of hair and reduce hair loss.",1683534639.363134,miscellaneous,Neutral

611,611,"As soon as i saw This Here , i was thinking that the science of stamcell related to cancer is No solution 
I was watching whats Happening with eine people got dick by cancer 

They Had mental issues 
Then they we're sourrounded by sick people or bad people 
They Had Special allergical reactions 
They ate Things is Not healthy 
Some drugs addicted 
Some Had funghi in their House 
Contact with Hepatitis or Other infections 

Then Theres is realy Young human WHO Surfer genetic Problems and issues causing cancer 
But the question is also , what was going on with the mother and father while pregnancy 

I think that the Observation in This Case is Not a fundamental Basic information 

I think the Stamcells react to the nutritional Input and somehow its building an Independent organism 
Somehow symbiont somehow fully related to the human Body 
Thats what they call the differences between cancer types 

The medicine is searching for solutions on a technical chemical focused way

But lets say an asian is coming the USA or Europe
This Person ist suffering allergical reactions from trees flowers , the nutrition and almost Everything 
Sometimes without Symptoms Sometimes within

The medial Care taking for health is substances Made in Europe to heal european or US allergical reactions 
But its an asian reaction
Its Just an example 


Most Things is solved by cortison in many cases or antibiotics
If you Look at the asian Region , many Things is solved by Natural medicine 
Depending in the country Theres consumption of medicine or Naturals 

The human brain and the parts of the Body cancer or Other foreign reactions is happening should get the Attention 

I think you cant solve a Problem Just by watching some parts of a complex human Lifestyle 
If once followed the History of many different human then you can find Out Better what is going on 

When ever Investigations in my Body ist Made 
Its Like a cow going for the kill 
Its fast Money
Till its serious its fast money

Because the amount of Money coming Server by my symptoms  is Not high enough 
So in general a Life is collaterral 

If its collaterral how will you solve the Problem of healing cancer ??
This Video Here is a good information with different Views and Options 

But also within the Problem Here you have to watch people and their lives 
You have to noticed their Feelings their Habits , the nutrition and their health reactions 
As Well as their social Position and sourroundings , their sexual happiness 

If you live Scheiss a Highway Like me 
And your tired , No doctor is saying 

Oh your breathing the emissions of the Cars 
High concentrations 
I once asked different doctors 

They all Said ITS nothing 
But the science is saying Something different 

So be careful because the one is talking has a special conviction
And Special interests 
A judge dont hast to BE a judge 
He can Support criminals while making a decision for their prison time 
Taking drugs judging a drug Dealer 

Sadly Theres to many of These conclusions in mankind

Feels more like a moss that hair (but women like to touch it wink wink xd). I trim my head almost bald (to about 1mm every 2/3 days). I know what you feel. I went through minoxidil treatment and after 2 years dermatologist prescribed finasterid. Adding finasterid visibly slowed my hairloss and even might have promoted some growth. When I was 18 and taking finasterid for almost a year I went to cardiologist due to slightly elevated blood pressure. He told me with compassion (he was also bald) that those meds might slow/stop hairloss, but only as long as being taken. Also cost of meds can be harsh for some people. He also mention that side effects for such a young person can be quite severe and it's simply not worth it. He said sth like ""taking finasterid is like chemical castration"". It shocked me. That day I dumped those meds and lost my crown hair pretty dang fast. But I realised that this is inevitable. I also didn't want to take pills for the rest of my life. I have bad genetics and I can't do shit about that. I can either suck it up or let it destroy my life. Also some of my female friends told me that they like bald men :)

At the beginning it was harsh. I constantly looked in the mirror just like you. I found my way around that problem with humor. I started to joke with my friends about my bald head. It helped. There are many males that look dang good with bald head (like Jason Statham), but they have one thing in common. They are in excellent body shape. When I realised that I decided to lose weight and get in shape. I'm just in the beginning of weight loss jurney. I am also trying to get some nice facial hair.

If your hair problem is not caused by any serious hormonal or some other kind of disease and doctor checked you and your bloodwork and told that it's just typical male balding patterns I honestly, based on my own expierience, advise you to not take any minoxidil or finasterid or any of that crap. Mostly due to side effects that can cause you way greater trouble than shiny head :) Eat clean and hit the gym. You will do whatever you and your doctor decide for the best. 

Take care, I wish you best.","hey do not panic. i am almost 22 now. my hair began to fade when i wa 15. it wa horrible for me too. now i have only some tiny baby hair on my crown that doe not grow at all. feel more like a moss that hair (but woman like to touch it wink wink xd). i trim my head almost bald (to about 1mm every 2 3 days). i know what you feel. i went through minoxidil treatment and after 2 year dermatologist prescribed finasterid. adding finasterid visibly slowed my hairless and even might have promoted some growth. when i wa 18 and taking finasterid for almost a year i went to cardiologist due to slightly elevated blood pressure. he told me with compassion (he wa also bald) that those men might slow stop hairless, but only a long a being taken. also cost of men can be harsh for some people. he also mention that side effect for such a young person can be quite severe and it is simply not worth it. he said sth like taking finasterid is like chemical castration . it shocked me. that day i dumped those men and lost my crown hair pretty dang fast. but i realised that this is inevitable. i also did not want to take pill for the rest of my life. i have bad genetics and i cannot do shit about that. i can either suck it up or let it destroy my life. also some of my female friend told me that they like bald men :) at the beginning it wa harsh. i constantly looked in the mirror just like you. i found my way around that problem with humor. i started to joke with my friend about my bald head. it helped. there are many male that look dang good with bald head (like jason statham), but they have one thing in common. they are in excellent body shape. when i realised that i decided to lose weight and get in shape. i am just in the beginning of weight loss journey. i am also trying to get some nice facial hair. if your hair problem is not caused by any serious hormonal or some other kind of disease and doctor checked you and your woodwork and told that it is just typical male bolding pattern i honestly, based on my own experience, advise you to not take any minoxidil or finasterid or any of that crap. mostly due to side effect that can cause you way greater trouble than shiny head :) eat clean and hit the gym. you will do whatever you and your doctor decide for the best. take care, i wish you best.",1684398644.345144,miscellaneous,Negative

The learning curve is enormous. 
After listening to this episode, I just have to share my experience with my own hair regrowth involving stem cells.  All my life I was blessed with healthy, shiny, and voluminous hair. After suffering a severe illness, I was literally shedding hair and lost about 60 % of my hair volume within 2 months.
My doctor blamed it on hormonal change, but I learned that this phenomenon can occur 3 to 4 months after severe stress because hair follicles are very sensitive to physical or emotional stress. The medical term for this type of hair loss is 'telogen effluvium'
I already accepted the fact that my hair will never grow back to its healthy volume. 
I‚Äôm a healthcare practitioner and about half a year ago, I got introduced to a cutting-edge wellness product that comes in form of a little round patch and is known for stem cell activation and its regenerative/reverse aging effects.
I‚Äôm a scientifically minded individual and I go first to the science behind any product and always test a product on myself before I would suggest it to my family, clients, and others. 
My goal with the patches was to support my body's natural repair process, reducing inflammation, immune system support, and pain management. 
After only 2 months I realized a rapid hair re-growth. Today, after the 6-month mark, I have my shiny, healthy hair volume back, 100% On top of that fact, my grays are non-existent and my natural hair color returned.

728,728,"When I first saw how long this was, I decided to watch it anyways. I figured I would get some good tips for the hair on my scalp. What did surprise me was there was a little paragraph or two on which way is best to have your hair removed forever. And a talk about all those methods of pulling out the hair and which ones killed the hair follicle or just put it asleep a little. And how long and how expensive the different method of hair removal are and how long is each treatment with the general average cost. 

If this subject is not long enough then combined it with other podcast that you also think is little and play them on the same podcast. You can also explain why chemo therapy makes your hair fall out completely all over your body and then after the chemo is stop a month or two later here comes hair growing in. It was like baby hair. So stuff. Another thing about chemo hair loss is that the hair that grows back it not always the same color or texture that you began get. She straight haired people get surprises with curly hair for the rest of her life instead. This can work the other way round too. Like curly hair grown back as straight. The color of you hair can also change when it grows back. Why is this?

Hair changing can happen during puberty for a girl. Idk if it does for a boy. Probably though. I lived in Massachusetts and my husband, me, and my 12 yrs set of triplets (2girls & a boy). They are currently 21 yrs old. All with straight hair while we lived in Mass. We moved to south Florida when the kids were 12. My daughter Miranda kelp complaining about her curly hair and how she hated it. I didn't bother going into the bathroom to actually she her hair and when she came out of the bathroom she had already straighten. I thought she was a little kokoo or she was calling all the humidity down here getting in her straight hair and making it appear slightly curly. 

This went on for a bout of year. She also started menstruating has that year was finishing up. I happen to see her in a towel right from the shower and I was so shocked at how curly her hair had become. Especially since she had straight hair for 11 -  12 years. It's so pretty. But my point is that there are plenty of things that you could make a full or decent size podcast out of. And if too short then add another short one that you have wanted to do but couldn't bc it too was too short. 

PS Just in case you didn't know this. When girls go through puberty they are growing very fast. However, once the girl starts menstruating that is about how tall she will be. She might grow maybe an inch or two or three. But the sooner you start menstruating the shorter she become. 

That happened to my same daughter. She cam out of the womb much longer then my other two kids. They were born in October but their due date was in November. Unusual the the other mother to see how well that compared to all the other babies in America. All through the years she was at the 90 percentile for the height of other babies and child her age. She was 23 percentile when it came to measuring her waist and places like that. She was the tallest one in her class including taller than the boys. However, when she started menstruated, she grow just a tiny bit more, if at all. All the boys grown passed her and then all the girls who started menstruating can to a halt on growing but the damage was down. By the time the rest of the girls got their period 2,3,4, or 5 years later than my daughter had, all the girls or almost most of the girls were taller then my daughter. Good thing she did all that early growing. It kept her at a height of 5'3"", so not too bad but If would have been cool if she grew up to be much taller.  

And again if you are short on time you come also check into eye lashes. Why do some people have beautiful full curved eyelashes and I talking about women or men without any kind of makeup on. In the meantime, I have short, straight eyelashes the look horrible. I can't use masacrara bc my eyes get extremely itchy. I try curling them up but they don't like to stay. and Worse of all I can't seem to be able to wear the fake ones. I've tried everything. It should have been easy bc I down blink much.

If you read this let me know so that I can take my phone number back off this message.

851,851,"Great overview Andrew.  I have tried about 90% of treatments you reviewed so if anyone is interested I can give some thoughts.  First, I am a male and started losing hair (receding hairline) around the age 20 (1985).  My doctor gave me good advice.  He said, ‚Äútake a multivitamin, exercise, eat healthy, cut it short, don‚Äôt stress and enjoy your life‚Äù.  In retrospect, he was 100% correct.  I started Rogaine in the early 90‚Äôs not long after it came out.  I did notice a slowing of loss although I didn‚Äôt like the greasy feeling of the solution (2x per day).  When Propecia came out around 1998 I started it immediately and, in combination with Rogaine, saw about a 95% reduction in hair loss.  BTW, I was also eating right, exercising, taking vitamins, etc.  But, I did have very high stress jobs so that had an effect.  Fast forward to 2015.  My hair was maintaining (although 85% grey by then) and I didn‚Äôt see the side-effects that people touted.  No libido change although we had three little kids so that‚Äôs enough energy spend to drain libido anyways‚Ä¶but I digress.  I got quite ill in 2015 while traveling to China.  After that I noticed an increase in hair loss with significant loss of leg and arm hair.  My doctor (a different one) told me it was from aging.  I didn‚Äôt think it was.  In 2018 I was diagnosed with scarring alopecia and have been fighting that.  Up until 2016 I would actually see small angel hairs on my forehead telling me that the Rogaine/Propecia combo was working.  Then it all became hairless, smooth, and shiny.  My scalp often hurt as if it was burning and I would feel the same on my arms, legs, and back.  I am convinced that this all stemmed from an illness I caught in Asia or from getting my first flu shot in 2015 (I don‚Äôt react well to vaccines).  Here‚Äôs what I know works.  Propecia works very well and would be my #1 recommendation as long as you aren‚Äôt prone to the side-effects.  Rogaine also works well but frankly it‚Äôs tiring to apply it twice per day and then have the greasy feeling in your hair during work and on your pillow.  It‚Äôs inconvenient but works.  There are a million shampoos/conditioners touting miracles which I would ignore.  The ones I use are Nizoral (2x/week) and Klorane Shampoo with Quinine.  For some reason the Quinine in Klorane really helped my scalp inflammation and the burning sensation.  I also use Klorane‚Äôs conditioner.  In both cases, you need to leave the shampoos on for about 5 minutes to maximize benefits.  I have also used the shampoo/conditioner from Regenepure and had good results but found the Klorane was better.  I use a hair shampoo massager brush and ‚Äúpress‚Äù it into my scalp 60 times, twice daily for blood circulation and have found that to be effective as well.  You can get those on Amazon.  I‚Äôm 57 and still have a lot of hair but it‚Äôs been a hard fight.  In some ways, I think I should have followed my doctors advice from 1985.  I would have fretted a lot less if I had just ‚Äútaken my hair worries out of the equation‚Äù and lived my life.  But, in the mid-90‚Äôs I told my wife, ‚Äúby 2010 they will have cured balding and we‚Äôll all have hair, I just need to save as much of mine as I can‚Äù.  Then again I thought cold fusion would be commonplace by 2020 so I‚Äôm 0 for 2.  And last, I also considered hair transplants but I can‚Äôt because of my scarring alopecia diagnosis, the success rate is near zero.  Even then, one person once said, ‚Äúhair transplantation is like parachuting fresh troops into a field where everyone on the ground is dead or dying‚Äù.  Whatever hair you have there will still get its DNA queue and die off so then you‚Äôre stuck with only the transplanted hair.  Eventually you run out of donor hair to move.  We need hair to be grown in the lab that can be transplanted.

862,862,"Can Humans be Tamed?

We need to develop ourselves as human beings beyond our animate level of existence, and it is possible with a certain kind of education.

Developing ourselves as human beings means learning and balancing ourselves with the integral laws of nature operating on our lives. If we learn how to positively connect among each other in human society, with altruistic attitudes replacing our current egoistic attitudes, we then develop ourselves beyond the animate level of existence and become human beings in the fullest sense of the term.

First, we need to provide for our animate lives, giving our physical bodies the food, sex and family that they require, then after taking care of those essentials, we can begin our human development.

I understand your situation was quite different and you went through multiple stages of hair loss caused by seemingly different things, but for someone who‚Äôs just dealing with MPB, anti-androgens are quite effective.

2) I would not recommend rogaine to anyone, ESPECIALLY those only concerned with stopping their hair loss (and not regrowth).

Rogaine can cause facial bloating and drying of the skin around the areas it‚Äôs applied, grows back a minimal amount of poor quality hair, and the hair it does grow back immediately sheds out shortly after stopping (which is the same case with anti androgens, but they do a much better job at actually stopping and regrowing hair, and they don‚Äôt cause issues with your skin)

886,886,"¬†@rufus pennypacker¬† You might be right.  The timing was strange.  Luckily, I have good blood tests running back for about 8 years so I can track data from the same lab.  It was in the 2014-2016 period that ‚Äúsomething changed‚Äù.  I did get the flu vaccine in 2014 (at the urging of my doctor) and immediately got quite sick.  I was doing a lot of travel to Asia (China, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Vietnam) and so was getting sick either going or coming home.  It‚Äôs hard to be in Shanghai for 10 days and not have the air quality get to your lungs.  Anyways, I caught strange viruses that‚Äôs all I know.  My leg and arm hair started to thin quite a lot.  Groin, chest, armpit, and face were fine.  Talked to my doctor and he said it was aging (I was around 50 at the time).  I just didn‚Äôt buy it.  When I went to the transplant doctor, he took a look at my scalp and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 90% convinced you have scarring alopecia, how has nobody caught this?‚Äù  Mind you, I go to the dermatologist annually like clockwork for skin and hair.  My derm did a biopsy and it confirmed the SA.  He was mortified because we had been doing PRP for a year which we stopped because he said it‚Äôs like burning money.  When he reviewed the biopsy with me he said, ‚Äúwhen did you have malaria?‚Äù  I was shocked and said ‚Äúnever, I‚Äôm pretty sure I would have known if I ever had malaria‚Äù.  He said, ‚Äúwell, your lab results show that you‚Äôve been exposed to malaria‚Äù.  As you know, ‚Äúexposed‚Äù vs ‚Äúhad‚Äù are two different things.  He believes that the SA was exposure to some type of illness that might have triggered a malaria signature.  This is also how I stumbled on the Klorane shampoo with Quinine.  In 2016 I was working on a big project so was going quite a bit.  I was drinking Gin and Tonics since I was following a no carb diet (yes, lots of sugar in G&T‚Äôs).  I really noticed a positive difference in how my hair felt.  It wasn‚Äôt from the gin so I concluded the tonic and the tonic had quinine.  The quinine is anti-inflammatory and that led me to Klorane.  I‚Äôm convinced about the use of Quinine for my scalp inflammation.

900,900,"¬†@Kalaivani Satheesh Kumar¬† Hello Kalaivani, Sorry to hear of the pain this is causing you.  I would recommend to see a doctor/specialist who can help you understand what is happening.  Hair loss can  be caused by many factors such as poor diet, stress, environmental factors, underlying health conditions like Alopecia, and hormonal changes.  But, for the vast majority of men the cause is our friend DNA.  Understanding the root cause is critical because then your treatment is clearer (and more effective) thereafter.  If you self-diagnose you can chase around ‚Äúmiracle cures‚Äù and potentially make things worse.  I have read about Rosemary oil (and other oils) but have not tried them.  I know that many are good for limiting fungal growth around the hair shaft.  For sure, I would find a way to improve your sleep because sleep is critical for good physical/mental health, especially for someone at your age.  You need your sleep my friend.  Don‚Äôt worry about seeing some hair loss on the pillow or in the shower, that‚Äôs normal.  A normal head of hair loses 50-100 strands per day but they typically grow back.  If you have thin/fine hair to begin with that‚Äôs a different issue which I don‚Äôt have experience with.  Here‚Äôs some good news.  You‚Äôre at an age where the technology does exist to slow hair loss (primarily via anti-androgens like Finasteride).  For many people it nearly stops hair loss (it didn‚Äôt stop it for me, just slowed it considerably which was fine).  There is a lot of money in the balding business so you can bet that people are working on treatments.  So, the key for you is to maintain as much hair as you can and give science some time to bring other products to market.  But, remember that nothing is for free, there are side-effects that should not be ignored and you have to understand what price you may pay for treatment (money price and side-effects price).  Most drugs have side effects and some of them are quite nasty.  I‚Äôm 57 and have been fighting this battle since I was your age.  Sure, I still have hair but it has been a lot of work, I would say a burden.  I have friends & relatives who are balding or bald and they are successful, have happy relationships, many friends, and are living great lives.  Two of my best friends shave their heads but both are wealthy, healthy, and happy.  Get good advice from a doctor but focus on becoming the ‚Äúbest you‚Äù through a good diet, exercise, education, hard work, treating people well, and being a good person.  Smile more, laugh more, and be confident‚Ä¶‚Ä¶those things are just as attractive as having hair but they‚Äôre hard to do if you‚Äôre always worrying about your hair.  Good luck my friend.","alaivani satheesh kumar hello kalaivani, sorry to hear of the pain this is causing you. i would recommend to see a doctor specialist who can help you understand what is happening. hair loss can be caused by many factor such a poor diet, stress, environmental factors, underlying health condition like alopecia, and hormonal changes. but, for the vast majority of men the because is our friend dna. understanding the root because is critical because then your treatment is clearer (and more effective) thereafter. if you self diagnose you can chase around miracle cure and potentially make thing worse. i have read about rosemary oil (and other oils) but have not tried them. i know that many are good for limiting fungal growth around the hair shaft. for sure, i would find a way to improve your sleep because sleep is critical for good physical mental health, especially for someone at your age. you need your sleep my friend. don t worry about seeing some hair loss on the pillow or in the shower, that s normal. a normal head of hair loses 50 100 strand per day but they typically grow back. if you have thin fine hair to begin with that s a different issue which i don t have experience with. here s some good news. you re at an age where the technology doe exist to slow hair loss (primarily via anti androgen like finasteride). for many people it nearly stop hair loss (it didn t stop it for me, just slowed it considerably which wa fine). there is a lot of money in the bolding business so you can bet that people are working on treatments. so, the key for you is to maintain a much hair a you can and give science some time to bring other product to market. but, remember that nothing is for free, there are side effect that should not be ignored and you have to understand what price you may pay for treatment (money price and side effect price). most drug have side effect and some of them are quite nasty. i m 57 and have been fighting this battle since i wa your age. sure, i still have hair but it ha been a lot of work, i would say a burden. i have friend & relative who are bolding or bald and they are successful, have happy relationships, many friends, and are living great lives. two of my best friend shave their head but both are wealthy, healthy, and happy. get good advice from a doctor but focus on becoming the best you through a good diet, exercise, education, hard work, treating people well, and being a good person. smile more, laugh more, and be confident those thing are just a attractive a having hair but they re hard to do if you re always worrying about your hair. good luck my friend.",1683534653.356022,miscellaneous,Positive

939,939,"¬†@SAGAR KUMAR¬† Hi Sagar, I don't know because it should be prescribed after a review with a doctor.  There are some people who aren't good candidates for Finasteride so I would talk to a doctor.  I have not used topical Finasteride but am looking into it.  According to an article in Healthonline, ""One study published in the International Journal Of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics in 2014 found that scalp DHT was reduced by 68 to 75% with topical Finasteride treatment and 62 to 72% with oral Finasteride for men with androgenetic alopecia"".

I have never applied it to the back or sides of my head.  Typically, male pattern baldness tends to leave the sides and back of hair relatively alone with hair loss being along the hairline and top of the head.  You might have a genetic predisposition to this loss or there‚Äôs something else happening.  Since I have scarring alopecia, I visit some sites that show that people lose side/back hair with SA or other alopecia.  You could have a scalp biopsy done to determine if you have SA.  I tested negative for autoimmune disease but positive for SA.  SA is an autoimmune disorder.  To me, it sounds like you are doing everything you can, you are giving it a good fight.

965,965,"¬†@Goorie Henkel¬† Thanks for the info Goorie, I had not read about Propecia causing panic/anxiety.  One thing I know is that there is no ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù when it comes to drugs.  In a normal distribution, one would expect that a ‚Äútypical‚Äù response would be a certain outcome.  But, there are always tails and those tails could have extreme reactions which could, in some cases, result in death.  That‚Äôs extreme.  But, there is considerable affect as outcomes move toward the tails and with Propecia that could be anxiety/depression for some people.  I have not experienced this from Propecia but then again I‚Äôve lived a life, had extremely hard jobs, got married, raised kids, held mortgages, and had ups and downs like every single person who has ever lived.  And I‚Äôve had a couple of panic attacks as well as having had times of anxiety.  I didn‚Äôt know what it was at the time but now that I‚Äôve studied it I know that I‚Äôve had them.  Given presentations in front of large groups isn‚Äôt much fun for me so a bit of the symptoms of panic set in.  Nevertheless, I had these episodes before I started Propecia so can‚Äôt blame that, at least not for me.  On the other hand, I do believe that the pain of balding, for a high percentage of men, is painful‚Ä¶even depressing.  One might even have a panic attack about it.  I‚Äôve certainly looked in the mirror a few times and found myself pretty disgusted with life and the irony of losing hair.  If I were a young man and the shower showed droves of hair in my hands after shampooing I might well be set with panic and later with depression.  Yes, the whole thing stinks.  Again, at least for me.  I‚Äôll share this last bit of information.  I do some golfing and am lucky to go to a club that has many successful people as members.  So, I get to play with different folks (I am good friends with a club member).  Almost all of them are successful.  Wealthy, accomplished, and interesting people who I enjoy meeting.  I always laugh to myself after we‚Äôre done on the 18th and we all lift our caps and shake hands.  I‚Äôd say 75% of them are bald or quite balding.  A large number of them are short, pudgy, and bald which I always thought was the trifecta of bad news.  How wrong I‚Äôve been.  I laugh because I enjoy the company of these people because of who they are rather than what is under their Calloway hat.  And they certainly have done alright for themselves despite their hair loss.

1123,1123,"My hair has been regrowing over the last 6 or so months. Certainly nothing miraculous, and definitely slow going, but moving in the opposite direction that it had been for the decade prior. I've also noticed reversal of graying in my beard (gray at the tip, dark and healthy at the base.) Regrowing my hair was not my goal, just a side effect I noticed of other improvements I was making to my health. Only after I noticed regrowth did I start doing things specifically geared toward supporting hair growth.

I started tracking my food intake and adjusting my diet to ensure adequate micronutrient intake, several of which I was consistently getting too little of. Based on the research about absorption I started taking a weekly B12 supplement, as well as increasing my vitamin D intake after tracking my estimated D production from sunlight (since I worked outside and expected to get a fair amount from sunlight outside of the winter months, but that turned out not to be true.)

Based on a lone case study of a fecal microbiota transplant leading to spontaneous hair regrowth, I hypothesized that microbiome health could play a major role in hair regrowth (in addition to all of its other health impacts). To support microbiome health I started eating smaller quantities of a larger variety of foods throughout the week, increased my fiber intake to at least 50-100g daily (more in line with what's posited for traditional human diets, which had even more finger than that), and reduced things like salt and artificial sweeteners which show evidence of negative impact on the microbiome.

The foods I added that appear to boost hair growth based on the available research are capsaicin from hot peppers, about a tablespoon of pumpkin seeds, and soy... most often in the form of soymilk which contains soybeans and no other ingredients.

I had also gotten down to about 3 hours of sleep a night for months (my hair loss predates this, but I knew lack of sleep didn't help my overall health) which turned out to be from a faulty water filter on our high-manganese well water. This is in addition to a history of exposure to lead, black mold, and other environmental toxins. I started a regimen of liposomal glutathione and silymarin, as well as saunas, to support my body's elimination of the manganese and was able to return to 7-9 hours of sleep a night.

The last factor was the mechanical one. I'd noticed that my scalp was relatively numb, especially around the crown, and because I'd seen the research on microneedling, I hypothesized that any localized inflammation would increase blood flow and with it bring any nutrients needed for hair growth to that area. I don't have a dermaroller (especially since the ones commonly available are shorter than what the research suggested was most effective), so I've used a combination of brushing with a stiff boar bristle brush with enough pressure to induce a lasting inflammation response, or a long shower hot enough to do the same (120+ degrees Fahrenheit, using a shower wand to not expose one part of the body for too long and cause scalding.) I've contemplated using stinging nettles to induce an inflammation response to the scalp, but as of yet have not.

Over the last few months I've noticed thickening and darkening of existing hairs, as well as what appears to be new hairs regrowing in a greater density than before (after shaving my head there are significant numbers of hairs erupting after a few days as compared to existing healthy hairs that have already had a few days of growth.) I've started taking daily photos of my scalp to try to document any changes. Based on what I've seen so far, I'm optimistic that any hair that can regrow will have done so by the end of this year, plus or minus a few months, but only time will tell. My hair definitely feels thicker and healthier already.","my hair ha been growing over the last 6 or so months. certainly nothing miraculous, and definitely slow going, but moving in the opposite direction that it had been for the decade prior. i have also noticed reversal of grading in my beard (gray at the tip, dark and healthy at the base.) growing my hair wa not my goal, just a side effect i noticed of other improvement i wa making to my health. only after i noticed growth did i start doing thing specifically geared toward supporting hair growth. i started tracking my food intake and adjusting my diet to ensure adequate micronutrient intake, several of which i wa consistently getting too little of. based on the research about absorption i started taking a weekly b12 supplement, a well a increasing my vitamin d intake after tracking my estimated d production from sunlight (since i worked outside and expected to get a fair amount from sunlight outside of the winter months, but that turned out not to be true.) based on a lone case study of a fecal microbiota transplant leading to spontaneous hair growth, i hypothesized that microbiome health could play a major role in hair growth (in addition to all of it other health impacts). to support microbiome health i started eating smaller quantity of a larger variety of food throughout the week, increased my fiber intake to at least 50 100g daily (more in line with what is posited for traditional human diets, which had even more finger than that), and reduced thing like salt and artificial sweetness which show evidence of negative impact on the microbiome. the food i added that appear to boost hair growth based on the available research are capsaicin from hot peppers, about a tablespoon of pumpkin seeds, and soy. most often in the form of soymilk which contains soybean and no other ingredients. i had also gotten down to about 3 hour of sleep a night for month (my hair loss predates this, but i knew lack of sleep did not help my overall health) which turned out to be from a faulty water filter on our high manganese well water. this is in addition to a history of exposure to lead, black mold, and other environmental toxins. i started a regimen of ribosomal glutathione and silymarin, a well a sauna, to support my body's elimination of the manganese and wa able to return to 7 9 hour of sleep a night. the last factor wa the mechanical one. i would noticed that my scalp wa relatively num, especially around the crown, and because i would seen the research on microneedling, i hypothesized that any localized inflammation would increase blood flow and with it bring any nutrient needed for hair growth to that area. i do not have a dermaroller (especially since the one commonly available are shorter than what the research suggested wa most effective), so i have used a combination of brushing with a stiff boar brittle brush with enough pressure to induce a lasting inflammation response, or a long shower hot enough to do the same (120+ degree fahrenheit, using a shower wand to not expose one part of the body for too long and because scaling.) i have contemplated using stinging settle to induce an inflammation response to the scalp, but a of yet have not. over the last few month i have noticed ticketing and marketing of existing hairs, a well a what appears to be new hair growing in a greater density than before (after shaving my head there are significant number of hair eruption after a few day a compared to existing healthy hair that have already had a few day of growth.) i have started taking daily photo of my scalp to try to document any changes. based on what i have seen so far, i am optimistic that any hair that can region will have done so by the end of this year, plus or minus a few months, but only time will tell. my hair definitely feel thicker and healthier already.",1683534660.447189,miscellaneous,Neutral

1328,1328,"Hormonal Regulation of Hair Growth
üíä Hair growth is strongly regulated by hormones such as estrogen, thyroid hormone, insulin-like growth factor, and androgens like testosterone, which control the pool of stem cells that give rise to hair growth, making chemical approaches to hair loss treatment important.
üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è The stem cells that give rise to hair are endogenous stem cells that we all have, and tapping into these cells can help halt hair loss or replace lost hair.
üíá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Half of all people by age 50 start to lose their hair due to testosterone and testosterone derivative induced hair loss, which is true in both men and women.
üíá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is responsible for hair loss in both men and women as it binds to the Androgen receptor at five times the Affinity of testosterone.

üíá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ""Understanding the biology of hair growth can help us hold on to the hair we have and stimulate new hair growth.""

Mechanical Stimuli for Hair Regrowth
üß¨ Stem cells and cells that give rise to the pigment of the hair are located in the hair bulb, which is shaped like a bulb and is responsible for creating the various types of cells that make up the actual hair.
üí° Understanding the three basic phases of hair growth, including the antigen phase, is extremely important toward understanding hair replacement and slowing hair loss.
üß¨ The rate of hair growth is not determined by how fast hair is created, but rather by the duration of the antigen phase, which can vary between individuals.
üíä The combination of microneedling and minoxidil treatment together is far more effective than either of those treatments alone, especially in recovering ""dead zones"" on the scalp.
üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Combination treatments that involve a mechanical stimulus and a chemical stimulus are always going to be better than either one alone, with microneedling being the most effective mechanical stimulus for hair regrowth.

Chemical Approaches to Hair Loss Treatment
üíä There are various chemical and mechanical approaches to halting and reversing hair loss, including minoxidil, dutasteride, Ketoconazole, microneedling, and thyroid estrogen.
üíâ Minoxidil, a drug developed to treat hypertension, can also be effective in slowing rates of hair loss by extending the antigen phase through increased blood flow to the scalp and other areas of the body.
üß™ Insulin growth factor one and cyclic amp are key chemical players in regulating hair growth, with igf-1 acting as the accelerator and cyclic amp transmitting signals to control gene expression.

1383,1383,"Regarding the Saw Palmetto berry, I asked Chat GPT and this is what it had to say about the discovery of the berry and also the research in relation to the 5-alpha reductase:. I provided sources on the bottom as well:

DISCOVERY:
Saw palmetto (Serenoa repens) is a plant native to the southeastern United States. Its use for medicinal purposes dates back to the indigenous people of the region, who used the berries for a variety of health conditions.

The European settlers of the region learned about saw palmetto from the Native Americans, and in the late 19th century, it began to be used by herbalists and physicians in the United States.

In the early 20th century, saw palmetto began to gain recognition as a potential treatment for enlarged prostate, a condition known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The berries were found to have properties that could help reduce inflammation and decrease the production of certain hormones that contribute to prostate growth.

Since then, saw palmetto has become a popular natural remedy for BPH and is also used for other purposes, such as improving urinary tract function and reducing hair loss.

THE INHIBTION OF 5-ALPHA:
The inhibition of 5-alpha reductase by saw palmetto was not discovered until much later, in the 1990s. 5-alpha reductase is an enzyme that converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone that is known to contribute to prostate growth.

Researchers began to investigate the mechanisms behind saw palmetto's effects on the prostate and discovered that it contains several compounds that can inhibit the activity of 5-alpha reductase. These compounds, known as fatty acids and phytosterols, block the conversion of testosterone to DHT, which can help reduce prostate growth.

Since then, several studies have been conducted to investigate the effectiveness of saw palmetto in treating BPH, with some studies suggesting that it can be as effective as prescription medications such as finasteride, which also works by inhibiting 5-alpha reductase. However, the exact mechanism of action of saw palmetto is still not fully understood, and more research is needed to fully understand its effects on the prostate and other health conditions.

1516,1516,"Hi Dr. Huberman, as usual, great episode. You've covered so much in these 2 hours that can really save somebody from years of research and misleading information. As someone who has delved into research on stopping androgenic alopecia, I would like to add some points that I think everyone watching would have some benefit from. If any of you happens to read this comment, please leave a thumbs up so that more people can see this and hopefully learn something new. 
- Dermapen and similar devices are a better option than dermarollers because of the way the needles puncture your scalp
- Tretinoin applied topically can increase minoxidils efficacy by upregulating follicular sulfotransferase enzymes
- Both microneedling and tretinoin can make you a responder to topical minoxidil or decrease the application from 2x to 1x per day to achieve the same or greater results (even though 1x per day is sufficent for most people due to minoxidils halflife)
- Topical caffeine should be used in dosages not greater than 0.2% (some studies used 0.005% solutions with success), greater dosages could potentially do more harm than good
- Topical finasteride solution of 0.025% reduces serum DHT levels by 24.4% (compared to ~70% reduction from 1mg of oral) - I think that you've mentioned this in your episode with Kyle Gillet
- Topical dutasteride can lower systemic DHT even lower due to being a bigger molecule, thus going less systemic, and having a lower half-life at low dosage
- Topical anti-androgens can also be used to avoid inhibiting 5-AR but they can carry their own set of side effects
Now, I would also like to point some things that really caught my attention that hopefully you'll understand as a way to promote a healthy debate and further improve our understanding of androgenic alopecia:
- This is the first time I hear someone mention increased prolactin due to topical minoxidil usage, although it makes sense, I think that most people should not be worried about this and that it is a fairly safe treatment option, and that you exaggerated the side effects of minoxidil a bit.
- While you were harsh on minoxidil, you proposed saw palmettto as a fairly benign option, which in my opinion should be regarded as a weak 5-AR inhibitor and thus contain the same side effect profile as finasteride and dutasteride (although with lower prevalence due to it's lower strength).
- Dutasteride is used by men that can't achieve the desired effect of finasteride because of their sensitivity to androgens (as you've mentioned 90% of people achieve the effect using finasteride), so it can be a bit misleading to say that they start using it only because of it's ability to provide faster results.
- Some side effects of 5-AR inhibitors start early on in the treatment and disappear after a week or two, while others experience them further on it the treatment and have to wait a longer time for them to dissipate (which can resemble post finasteride syndrome).
I would like to conclude this comment with a request for you Dr. Huberman to further investigate the 5-ARs function in producing neurosteroids (which could also be a potential cause of the post finasteride syndrome). As someone who is interested in neuroscience and psychology, I would really love to see your review of the literature on this topic and a potential mentioning of this topic in a further hair/hair loss prevention video. Also a video on neck, and neck training would be awesome, haha.
Thank you for your podcast and your contribution to society.

1537,1537,"The cause of my hair fall problem was finally identified: using the incorrect shampoo. Most individuals, including myself, only search for shampoos that are free of parabens and sulfates. However, there are many other toxic chemicals present in shampoos that can contribute to hair fall, such as formaldehyde, PEG, EDTA, phthalates, silicones, fragrances, colors, MEA, TEA, and Quaternium15. Continued use of these chemicals can cause notable issues, such as scalp buildup, dandruff, dryness, and reduced hair strength over an extended period. After extensive research, I found a natural shampoo that is entirely free of these harmful chemicals and began using 100% natural hair oil. As a result, my hair fall has stopped, and I've even noticed the emergence of new baby hairs on the right side of my scalp.
My consistent experimentation and education have given me the ability to confidently read any product label and easily differentiate between good and bad beauty products.","the because of my hair fall problem wa finally identified: using the incorrect shampoo. most individuals, including myself, only search for shampoo that are free of parade and sulfate. however, there are many other toxic chemical present in shampoo that can contribute to hair fall, such a formaldehyde, peg, eta, phthalates, silicone, fragrance, colors, mea, tea, and quaternium15. continued use of these chemical can cause notable issues, such a scalp buildup, dandruff, dress, and reduced hair strength over an extended period. after extensive research, i found a natural shampoo that is entirely free of these harmful chemical and began using 100% natural hair oil. a a result, my hair fall ha stopped, and i have even noticed the emergence of new baby hair on the right side of my scalp. my consistent experimentation and education have given me the ability to confidently read any product label and easily differentiate between good and bad beauty products.",1683534679.549986,miscellaneous,Neutral

1698,1698,"This was a masterclass of knowledge, and I would like to add a few things based on my own journey. Feel free to correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.

1. It was my understanding that topical finasteride leads to lower side effects due to less systemic absorption when comparing 1mg orally vs 1 mg topically daily.

2. It seems like Dutasteride, when applied topically, not only reduces more scalp dht than finasteride but also has less systemic absorption. Apparently, this is explained by its molecule structure.

3. When choosing minoxidil, it has been shown that Retinoic acid can boost results significantly. In other words, it will lead to better outcomes to apply 5% minoxidil + Retinoic Acid than using 10% minoxidil.

4. Literature says that to optimise results, micro-needling should be performed no more than once every one or two weeks. Recovery time is necessary for scalp healing.

5. Nizoral shampoo leads to better results when left for 10 minutes sitting on the scalp. 3-5 minutes seems like insufficient time to penetrate the scalp effectively.

6. Scalp massage, when performed twice daily (for 15 minutes each session), leads to significant hair growth, though there is still a lack of robust evidence. It seems like scalp elasticity it‚Äôs also a factor for hair loss (have you seen that every bald guy has a shiny and tense scalp?)

7. It‚Äôs possible to get a topical solution that includes everything: caffeine, minoxidil, finasteride, etc., for example, through minoxidilmax.com

8. Finally, there is a lot of misleading information, and I think the best place that I have found so far to learn and be guided by someone with vast experience is perfecthairhealth.com (better than a regular doctor, in my opinion)

I hope this may be useful for someone.

I did that for about 3 months, didn't feel like it was doing anything so I uppped my dose to 2.5mg everyday and started to experience some minor headaches. I then lowered it to 2.5 every other day. That seemed like a good sweet spot. I started to notice thickening of hair/growth and less hair scattered around my place. As you said after awhile it starts to taper off and to me it seemed like it was regressing so I upped my dose slowly.

What worries me is that you kept emphasizing the 5mg dosage, as though its a really high dose, and secondly I feel that within a year or two I will probably see the effects taper off again, if not regress.

No discussion of Telogen Effluvium, macro or micro nutrient disorders, gut disorders that can lead to malnutrition and hair loss, stress, cortisol, TNF-A and Interleukin etc. This just parrots the commonly held belief that DHT is responsible for all 'male pattern balding' due in large part to faulty logic.

1925,1925,"¬†@Christina's Curiosity¬† While it is possible that creatine supplementation upregulated 5-alpha-reductase activity in these males (potentially leading to increased formation of DHT), no study has reported hair loss/baldness in humans.

To date, 12 other studies have investigated the effects of creatine supplementation (i.e. doses ranging from 3-25 g/day for 6 days to 12 weeks) on testosterone. Two studies reported small, physiologically insignificant increases in total testosterone after six and seven days of supplementation [65, 66], while the remaining ten studies reported no change in testosterone concentrations. In five of these studies [67‚Äì71], free testosterone, which the body uses to produce DHT, was also measured and no increases were found.

In summary, the current body of evidence does not indicate that creatine supplementation increases total testosterone, free testosterone, DHT or causes hair loss/baldness.

2022,2022,"Thank you so much for this podcast!

Minoxidil topical goes as LOTION or FOAM, and the magic behind Minoxidil is that it will go systemic at a much lower % compared to oral one.

Minoxidil topical half-life is 22h, and that's why it's used once a day; however, for men, we noticed that twice is best because it keeps the concentration well above 50% during the whole 24h period.

This is why Minoxidil lotion or foam is considered OTC by FDA.

The exact mechanism of action is NOT known, and it has 3 possible ways: increase blood flow, increase fenestration, or creation of NEW ATP Potassium Channel Openers.

Minoxidil oral is prescription only, and the reason for that is because of its systemic side effects.

Minoxidil topical side effects categorize into two: skin-related and drug-related.
Skin-related: irritation, itchiness, dandruff, or redness - all these are caused by the recipe that the company you buy the product from creates its formulation. (often times relates to PG - Propylene Glycol)
Drug-related: it's because of a sensitivity to this specific medication, and you can do nothing. (0.4% of total users will encounter these: swelling, weight gain, and increased heart rate)

I hope that this extra info helps.
With respect, Tudor. @thehairlossdude

P.S. I must mention that my opinion is biased, because we sell minoxidil lotion bundled with different other products and programs. So I kindly ask you to check my comment and come with contra arguments.","thank you so much for this podcast! minoxidil topical go a motion or foam, and the magic behind minoxidil is that it will go systemic at a much lower % compared to oral one. minoxidil topical half life is 22h, and that is why it is used once a day however, for men, we noticed that twice is best because it keep the concentration well above 50% during the whole 24h period. this is why minoxidil motion or foam is considered utc by fda. the exact mechanism of action is not known, and it ha 3 possible ways: increase blood flow, increase penetration, or creation of new atp potassium channel openers. minoxidil oral is prescription only, and the reason for that is because of it systemic side effects. minoxidil topical side effect categorize into two: skin related and drug related. skin related: irritation, itchiness, dandruff, or redress all these are caused by the recipe that the company you buy the product from creates it formulation.

A plethora of methods are available to reduce low-grade inflammation which may translate to decreased hair loss. Time-restricted eating being one of the better ones. 4) PRP-treatment will provide growth factors to the recipient area that will likely increase hair growth. Puncturing the skin in PRP is not the primary method of action.  5) Nanoxidil has a smaller molecular size and is claimed to be more efficient than common minoxidil, so the vasodilation could be more profound. 6)  Soft-tissue calsification of the scalp could be a hair loss factor.

2203,2203,"Finasteride messed up my MEMORY so badly that I will make this comment before I even watch the episode. BEWARE.

This was circa 2010. Google and hair loss forums at the time were basically repeating ad nauseam that other than transplants and novel treatment options, the big 3 were minoxidil, finasteride, and dutasteride. Minoxidil reputedly had lower efficacy and seemed a chore to apply all night every night. Durasteride was not FDA approved for hair loss and still somewhat novel itself. Naturally finasteride seemed the responsible approach. And I consulted Google, hair loss forums, Merck, my doctor, and my pharmacist about it. All that any of them highlighted to me to watch out for was libido side effects ""in ~2% of men"" and that were I to experience this, that it should subside ""within 2 weeks"" of stopping finasteride ""as it didn't have a long half-life"".

Well, I didn't experience any libido effects. Instead, slowly, perniciously, it made my memory so bad that I one day realized I could no longer even remember what I had for lunch. And the worst thing about a foggy brain is it can't troubleshoot itself. Like a person with Alzheimer's not knowing they have Alzheimer's. Couple that with the fact that you usually take longer to notice issues no one told you to be on guard for. Much like you personally probably didn't notice your hair thinning until you'd thinned a fair amount. It took me ultimately a year to notice my memory had become Swiss cheese. Took fights with my girlfriend where she had insisted she told me something, and I, insisting I had always had a good memory, insisted she hadn't.

When I finally clued in and started Googling ""finasteride memory loss"", I finally saw a bunch of forums, that had never showed up during my initial search for ""finasteride side effects"", where a great many people were discussing the memory loss and brain fog finasteride caused them and coping with it. Some reported recovering fairly quickly after stopping finasteride, some reported still having terrible memory years later.

I quit that garbage instantly. I think it took ~6 months for me personally to see any memory improvements. And a decade hence, having adopted a bunch of systems like writing things down, repeating to myself things I want to remember, etc, my memory is back to okay. But I still can't remember what I had last meal half the time.

(To be sure, because don't think I hadn't asked myself this: I have never in my life done drugs, I don't drink, I was not on any other medication, I was not on a single other vitamin or supplement at the time, ate clean, drank solely water and green tea, slept perfectly well, and I did not have any other health issues, or a history of health issues. ALL I had changed leading up to that memory failure was I got on finasteride. If I recall correctly, recommended dose was 1mg and I took 0.5-1mg.)

Your mind, your very person, is worth more than your hair. Believe me. Watch the f‚Äî out. üôè","finasteride messed up my memory so badly that i will make this comment before i even watch the episode. beware. this wa circa 2010. google and hair loss forum at the time were basically repeating ad nausea that other than transplant and novel treatment options, the big 3 were minoxidil, finasteride, and dutasteride. minoxidil reputedly had lower efficacy and seemed a core to apply all night every night. durasteride wa not fda approved for hair loss and still somewhat novel itself. naturally finasteride seemed the responsible approach. and i consulted google, hair loss forums, mercy, my doctor, and my pharmacist about it. all that any of them highlighted to me to watch out for wa libro side effect in 2% of men and that were i to experience this, that it should subsid within 2 week of stopping finasteride a it did not have a long half life . well, i did not experience any libro effects. instead, slowly, perniciously, it made my memory so bad that i one day realized i could no longer even remember what i had for lunch. and the worst thing about a foggy brain is it cannot troubleshoot itself. like a person with alzheimer's not knowing they have alzheimer's. couple that with the fact that you usually take longer to notice issue no one told you to be on guard for. much like you personally probably did not notice your hair thinning until you would twinned a fair amount. it took me ultimately a year to notice my memory had become swiss cheese. took fight with my girlfriend where she had insisted she told me something, and i, insisting i had always had a good memory, insisted she had not. when i finally clue in and started googling finasteride memory loss , i finally saw a bunch of forums, that had never showed up during my initial search for finasteride side effect , where a great many people were discussing the memory loss and brain fog finasteride caused them and coping with it. some reported recovering fairly quickly after stopping finasteride, some reported still having terrible memory year later. i quit that garbage instantly. i think it took 6 month for me personally to see any memory improvements. and a decade hence, having adopted a bunch of system like writing thing down, repeating to myself thing i want to remember, etc, my memory is back to okay. but i still cannot remember what i had last meal half the time.

Due to multiple factors in my life, stress, and depression, my hair started thinning when I was 25. The hairline on the sides started pulling back a lot, and I've been seeing constant falloff while showering.

Now when I'm 30, 7 months ago, I decided to do something about it, and my dermatologist prescribed me two things:
1. MERZ pills for skin and hair (google the ingredients) - first 3 months one pill in the morning one in the evening.
2. Minoxidil 5% spray application - two times per day (morning, evening).

I've been persistent and the results after 6 months are more than surprising.  Hair thinning is stopped completely, and I can see loads of thin baby hair growing in receding areas.
My hair is noticeably thicker ( not as it used to be but an improvement nevertheless) and now when I wash my hair, I can barely notice any fallen hair.

Seeing results, I will give up on hair transplant, since my anxiety regarding my hair is gone, and my motivation is up.

2219,2219,"okay so im 18 and i saw first signs of balding at 15 
my hairline was going back and back 
my father told me that it was normal for teens to see some sort of hairfall 
but later it was getting kindda worse a
so i consulted a doctor 
he gave me menoxidil 2% or something like that and for around 5 months there were no signs of hairgrowth but after that hairfall stopped 
and lil bit of regrowth was also there 
since then i am using menoxidil time to time and it works just fine 

also i was kindda obese earlier and trust me if you exercise your hair will be healthy
also diet plays a major role too 
like if you eat right you will know that you dont really need to use menoxidil that much 


also game changer for me are these things ----> 
TURMERIC HOT WATER (x 2 in a day)
GREEN TEA( x 1 in a day)
ALMONDS (1 handful anytime)
CURRY LEAVES (4 to 5 empty stomach in morning)
MENOXIDIL CAN BE USED 2 TIMES AFTER 2 BATHS IN A DAY (2 BATHS ARE NOT NECESSARY)
exercise (running is best according to me) x 3 in a week (10MIN TO 50MIN ACCORDING TO YOU)
1 cup warm milk with turmeric before bed
NOTE-------->
DO NOT ADD FULL SPOON OF TURMERIC POWDER  IN ONE CUP OF WATER 
THE GOAL IS TO CONSUME 1 SPOON OF TURMERIC IN HEALTHY WAY 
SO ADD VERY LITTLE AMOUNT OF TURMERIC EVERY TIME SO THAT BY THE END OF DAY IT ADDS UP TO 1 FULL SPOON

ALSO DO NOT OVEREAT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO NOT OVEREAT.

Thank you for the AMAZING content like always!
Would like to share with you my experience,
I am a 36y/o Dude,
Been maintaining a very long hair since the end of my mandatory service (Israel :) ),
I am already around 7 years ""No Poo"", if you are not familiar with it, it is a practice of completely avoiding shampoo use,
There are many rinsing and washing techniques, i am utilizing only Apple cider vinegar and Baking soda rinses,
Alkaline BS washes sebum buildup, ACV rinse balances scalp PH post BS washes, and of course serves cleansing advantages too.
ACV rinses can be done more often not post BS washes, but not the other way around.

ever since i am Nopoo, I've noticed a noticeable improvement in hair loss avoidance and dandruff buildup,
I used to shampoo every other day back in the day, and sebum buildup after 3 days was unbearable,
Now, if i don't wash for even 2-3 weeks, the sebum buildup is almost unnoticeable.

would you kindly be able to address to how the aspect of such practices might affect future hair loss further avoidance, or any other things regarding you see fit :) 

Best Regards & Many Thanks

2542,2542,"¬†@Taylor Giles¬† Here's a quick summary of the video I previously mentioned:

The video is divided in 9 parts:

‚Ä¢ ""Bludflow"" - in this part the guy debunks the theory that bloodflow has to do anything with androgenic alopecia. This theory was dismantled years ago but doctor Huberman tried to resurrect it by saying that bringing bloodflow to the scalp obviously causes hairgrowth because of oxygen delivery. He doesn't mention any research that supports this. If you want to hear the full debunk of the bloodflow theory watch the video because he really goes into detail and actually cites studies.

‚Ä¢ ""Minoxidil"" - in this part he shows a video of Huberman saying that Minoxidil (first FDA approved drug for hair loss) works by bringing bloodflow to the scalp. There are theories about Minoxidil's true mechanism of action but researchers say that the theory that Huberman presented is the least likely option. 

‚Ä¢ ""Minoxidil and prolactin"" - in this part he shows Hubermans claim that Minoxidil side effects are fluid retention and hyperprolactinemia. He cites no studies that claim that Minoxidil causes high prolactin levels. Haircafe debunks this with a study that says that no increases in prolactin were found in women, and also from the FAIRS database of post marketing drugs side effects there are only three reported cases of spiked prolactin of 17930 minoxidil users.

‚Ä¢ ""Caffeine"" - in this part Haircafe says that caffeine is not a comparable growth stimulant to topical Minoxidil and that Hubermans claims about caffeine are based on studies that are biased and not really good because the authors of the study were employees of a company that makes caffeine hair growth stimulants. Haircafe says that caffeine can be a mild growth stimulant, but it cannot be compared to minoxidil in the slightest. 

‚Ä¢ ""Botox"" - Haircafe shows a part of the video in which Huberman says that botox can be used in people suffering from AGA because it releases tension in the scalp and brings more bloodflow to it. Haircafe says that there are studies on botox and AGA and that botox can be efficacious but not in the way Huberman presented it. Botox can block the negative growth factor TGF-Œ≤1 and therefore block some DHT in the scalp and it doesn't work by bringing bloodflow as Huberman says.

‚Ä¢ ""Microneedling"" - Huberman said that microneedling can be an effective treatment for hairloss by bringing bloodflow to the scalp. We already know that bloodflow is useless for hair growth so this claim isn't correct. Haircafe says that the only thing microneedling is useful for in terms of hair growth stimulation is for better absorption of topical minoxidil. But even that isn't really useful because tretinoin applied topically to the scalp makes minoxidil more efficacious and is a much better and safer option than microneedling.

‚Ä¢ ""Saw Palmetto"" - Haircafe says that Huberman unnecessarily fear mongers about finasteride and shows a part of the podcast in which he says that Saw Palmetto is safer alternative to finasteride (a drug that blocks 5-alpha reductase - an enzyme that converts testosterone to DHT the main culprit of hairloss). Saw Palmetto just isn't efficacious enough for blocking DHT as other drugs such as fin or dutasteride because it's a mild DHT blocker that really doesn't do anything. 

‚Ä¢ ""DHT"" - Haircafe shows a part in which Huberman says that blocking the 5-alpha reductase and therefore DHT can cause a number of side effects such as: mental vigour, physical vigour, strength, healing capacity, libido etc. Haircafe shows a study that says that DHT is necessary in fetal development but in adult physiology it doesn't play a significant role. Haircafe did a whole video series that has like ten parts that dismantles arguments that say that DHT is an important hormone in adulthood so if you're interested in that watch it, I think it's called something like ""Why DHT is a trash hormone"". 

‚Ä¢ ""Post Finasteride Syndome"" - Haircafe basically says that PFS is a myth, he also has lots of videos about it. Huberman unnecessarily fear mongers about finasteride and its side effects.","taylor file here is a quick summary of the video i previously mentioned: the video is divided in 9 parts: bludflow in this part the guy debut the theory that bloodflow ha to do anything with androgen alopecia. this theory wa dismantled year ago but doctor superman tried to resurrect it by saying that bringing bloodflow to the scalp obviously cause hairgrowth because of oxygen delivery. he doe not mention any research that support this. if you want to hear the full debut of the bloodflow theory watch the video because he really go into detail and actually cite studies. minoxidil in this part he show a video of superman saying that minoxidil (first fda approved drug for hair loss) work by bringing bloodflow to the scalp. there are theory about minoxidil's true mechanism of action but researcher say that the theory that superman presented is the least likely option. minoxidil and prolactin in this part he show hubermans claim that minoxidil side effect are fluid retention and hyperprolactinemia. he cite no study that claim that minoxidil cause high prolactin levels. haircafe debut this with a study that say that no increase in prolactin were found in women, and also from the fair database of post marketing drug side effect there are only three reported case of spiked prolactin of 17930 minoxidil users. caffeine in this part haircafe say that caffeine is not a comparable growth stimulate to topical minoxidil and that hubermans claim about caffeine are based on study that are biased and not really good because the author of the study were employee of a company that make caffeine hair growth stimulate. haircafe say that caffeine can be a mild growth stimulate, but it cannot be compared to minoxidil in the slightest. book haircafe show a part of the video in which superman say that book can be used in people suffering from aga because it release tension in the scalp and brings more bloodflow to it. haircafe say that there are study on book and aga and that book can be efficacious but not in the way superman presented it. book can block the negative growth factor gf 1 and therefore block some dot in the scalp and it doe not work by bringing bloodflow a superman says. microneedling superman said that microneedling can be an effective treatment for hairless by bringing bloodflow to the scalp. we already know that bloodflow is useless for hair growth so this claim is not correct. haircafe say that the only thing microneedling is useful for in term of hair growth stimulation is for better absorption of topical minoxidil. but even that is not really useful because tretinoin applied typically to the scalp make minoxidil more efficacious and is a much better and safer option than microneedling. saw palette haircafe say that superman unnecessarily fear longer about finasteride and show a part of the podcast in which he say that saw palette is safer alternative to finasteride (a drug that block 5 alpha reductase an enzyme that convert testosterone to dot the main culprit of hairless). saw palette just is not efficacious enough for blocking dot a other drug such a fin or dutasteride because it is a mild dot blocker that really doe not do anything. dot haircafe show a part in which superman say that blocking the 5 alpha reductase and therefore dot can cause a number of side effect such as: mental vigor, physical vigor, strength, healing capacity, libro etc. haircafe show a study that say that dot is necessary in fetal development but in adult physiology it doe not play a significant role. haircafe did a whole video series that ha like ten part that dismantled argument that say that dot is an important hormone in adulthood so if you are interested in that watch it, i think it is called something like why dot is a trash hormone . post finasteride syndrome haircafe basically say that po is a myth, he also ha lot of video about it. superman unnecessarily fear longer about finasteride and it side effects.",1683534717.269783,miscellaneous,Neutral

2640,2640,"This podcast from Huberman was quite a letdown, so much mention of expensive and unnecessary products. In my experience I regained my hair by focusing on creating a healthy scalp microbiome, which meant: 1) No more use of shampoo (they are chemical disruptors and kill the microbiome). 2) Doing a weekly scalp scrub exfoliation with a mix of honey and pink sea salt. 3) Brushing my hair every day first thing in the morning and last think at night (with a wooden brush, which distributes the healthy oils and creates blood flow). 4) Some morning sun exposure to the hair. 5) When I feel some day I had sweat a lot I apply some organic apple cider vinegar (or lemon) diluted with water to the scalp and then rinse it with water. 6) Once a week some hair nutrition thing like an egg mask or a rice water mask (all this for 20 minutes). Also sometimes applying spirluna or matcha with honey to the scalp for some minutes block DHT (I usually apply it before meditating for 30 minutes after yoga 7) doing yoga, relaxing and always finishing with an 8 minute headstand (good for blood circulation to the scalp) and for being stress free. 8) Healthy eating, nothing obsessive, but considering eating red meat, green vegs, eggs and fruits. 9) Filter tap water that you drink and also very important to use a filter shower (the chlorine chemicals and other toxins are absorbed a lot by the scalp). 10) Trust your intuition and nature and understand that most of the pharma industry (it is and industry that needs perpetual clients) is designed to keep you hooked to meds for life.

2705,2705,"My notes:

Hair, including its biology and how to slow or reverse hair loss. It dispels myths about balding and hair replacement, and is separate from the host's teaching and research roles. 
  *Introduction to the Huberman Lab podcast
  *Discussion on science and science-based tools for everyday life
  *The topic of hair and its fascination from a cellular biology and stem cell perspective
  *The host's background as a neurobiology and ophthalmology professor at Stanford School of Medicine
  *Various ways science has taught us to slow or reverse hair loss
  *Different durations of hair growth on different parts of the body
  *Every hair has its own stem cell niche in the follicle
  *Factors determining the length of a hair and what regulates stem cells
  *Mechanical, chemical, and hormone-related approaches to halting and reversing hair loss
  *Dispelling common myths about balding and hair replacement
The section covers the benefits of Ketone IQ supplement and Roca eyeglasses, and explores the biology and psychology of hair loss. Some key points are:
  *Ketone IQ is a supplement that increases blood ketones, providing benefits even if one is not following a ketogenic diet.
  *Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses are designed to compensate for the visual system's challenges and offer an extensive range of styles.
  *Hair loss can lead to anxiety and depression in many people, and psychological well-being can impact hair growth and coloration.
  *Hair loss is a common problem, with about 50% of people experiencing significant hair loss by age 50, leading many to invest in halting or reversing it.
  *Hair loss occurs between ages 30 and 50 and becomes noticeable only by age 50.
The section discusses how our psychological states can impact hair growth and loss, the biology of hair growth, stem cells, and the different components that contribute to hair growth. The transcript also highlights the mechanical and chemical approaches to slowing and reversing hair loss.
  *People may notice hair thinning in a particular location when bright light permeates the outer boundary of their hair.
  *Psychological states can impact hair growth and loss.
  *The podcast will discuss how hair normally grows, why it grows at a certain rate, and why hair loss and graying can impact psychological state.
  *The podcast will cover both mechanical and chemical approaches to slowing and reversing hair loss.
  *Hormones like estrogen, thyroid hormone, insulin-like growth factor, testosterone, and its derivatives are involved in regulating hair growth.
  *Stem cells are cells that give rise to other cells and are present in all of us from the very beginning of life.
  *Every hair on the head or surface of the body is there because of a stem cell population.
  *The hair root is below the skin and has a little cave or pocket at the base of the root.
  *The hair shaft is the part that grows out above the skin.
  *Different components contribute to hair growth, and tapping into these can help halt hair loss or replace lost hairs.
This section discusses the structure of hair and its various components, including stem cells, keratin, and sebum. It also covers the erector pili muscle and its function in causing hairs to stand up. The section emphasizes the importance of sebum in both waterproofing the skin and protecting against infection.
  *There are populations of cells that have the ability to divide via mitosis and give rise to other cells, including progenitor cells and stem cells.
  *Daughter cells become the various types of cells that make up hair, which is made of keratin proteins stacked on top of each other.
  *The hair bulb, located in a pocket below the skin, contains not only stem cells, but also cells that give rise to the pigment of the hair called melanin.
  *Sebum is a substance produced by sebaceous glands next to hair roots that waterproofs the skin and acts as an antibacterial and antimicrobial agent.
  *The erector pili muscle lies diagonally between the hair bulb and the skin's surface and contracts when we get cold or scared, causing the hairs to stand up.
  *The erector pili muscle also creates dimples between the hairs that can trap air and warm our bodies.
  *Sebum is important in protecting against infection and plays a role in psoriasis and hair loss.
This section discusses the physiology of hair growth and why blood flow is important for hair growth. It also explains the three phases of hair growth and how hair grows from the bottom up. Additionally, it explains the importance of stem cells, melanocytes, sebum, and erector pili muscles for hair growth.
  *Hair growth is a robust aspect of physiology, and dogs like huskies can remain warm in the snow due to their hair.
  *Hairs trap air beneath them and create a blanket-like effect to keep the body warm.
  *Hair has several components such as the hair shaft, root portion, bulb region, stem cells, and pigmenting cells.
  *Capillaries provide nutrients, oxygen, and other essentials to the stem cells and melanocytes that support hair growth.
  *Hair growth is an active process that requires oxygen, nutrients, and blood flow.
  *Treatments that increase blood flow to the scalp can slow hair loss and extend hair growth duration.
  *Manipulations that increase blood flow to the scalp, such as scalp massage, are designed to be done in conjunction with other hair growth treatments.
  *Stem cells, melanocytes, sebum, and erector pili muscles are important components for hair growth.
  *Hair growth occurs in three phases: the antigen phase, catagen phase, and telogen phase.
  *Hair grows from the bottom up and extends out across the top of the skin during the antigen phase.
The transcript explains the three phases of the hair growth cycle - antigen, catagen, and telogen. The duration of these phases varies depending on the body region and person. The hair growth rate does not differ within a given body region. During the telogen phase, the stem cell population and melanocytes recede, leading to hair loss. However, some hairs can re-enter the growth cycle if there are sufficient stem cells, oxygen, and blood support.
  *Different hairs on the body have different growth phases and durations. For instance, the hairs on the scalp can grow for two to eight years, while the hairs on the eyebrows grow for a few months.
  *The rate of hair growth is not something that varies within a given body region. Differences in hair growth are primarily due to variations in the duration of the antigen and catagen phases between individuals.
  *The catagen phase is a breakdown phase where the hair recedes from the bulb region up towards the skin surface. Its duration also varies depending on the body region.
  *The telogen phase is a resting phase during which no new hair proteins are being added. The stem cell population and melanocytes recede during this phase, leading to hair loss.
  *The duration of the three phases makes up the hair growth cycle. Some hairs can re-enter the growth cycle if there are sufficient stem cells, oxygen, and blood support.
The section explains the importance of blood flow in hair growth and introduces minoxidil as a treatment for hair loss. It also touches on dosages and potential side effects of the drug.
  *Blood flow is critical for hair growth as it delivers nutrients and oxygen to the hair follicles.
  *Minoxidil is a drug originally developed to treat hypertension but is now used to slow hair loss by increasing blood flow to the scalp.
  *Minoxidil extends the antigen phase of hair growth, making it longer and slowing down hair loss.
  *Minoxidil dosages can be tricky to determine, and physicians will often start with a low dose and gradually increase it to avoid side effects.","my notes: hair, including it biology and how to slow

supplement that increase blood ketone, providing benefit even if one is not following a ketogenic diet. *rock eyeglass and sunglass are designed to compensate for the visual system's challenge and offer an extensive range of styles. *hair loss can lead to anxiety and depression in many people, and psychological well being can impact hair growth and coloration. *hair loss is a common problem, with about 50% of people experiencing significant hair loss by age 50, leading many to invest in halting or reversing it. *hair loss occurs between age 30 and 50 and becomes noticeable only by age 50. the section discus how our psychological state can impact hair growth and loss, the biology of hair growth, stem cells, and the different component that contribute to hair growth. the transcript also highlight the mechanical and chemical approach to slowing and reversing hair loss. *people may notice hair thinning in a particular location when bright light permeates the outer boundary of their hair. *psychological state can impact hair growth and loss. *the podcast will discus how hair normally grows, why it grows at a certain rate, and why hair loss and grading can impact psychological

Minoxidil, also known as Rogaine, can cause side effects like headaches, dizziness, and increases in the hormone prolactin. Dopamine and prolactin are antagonistic, so increases in prolactin can cause a decrease in libido, feelings of apathy, and gynecomastia in men. Women may experience swelling and edema of the tissues. Minoxidil works by increasing blood flow to the stem cell niche below the hair. It can be taken orally or applied topically, with dosage ranges varying greatly. Finding the correct dosage is important to avoid unwanted side effects.

  *Increases in blood flow around the clock is how minoxidil works to stimulate hair growth.
The transcript discusses the importance of increasing blood flow to the hair stem cell niche to maintain hair, slow hair loss, or even regrow hair. It mentions using low-dose tadalafil as a way to increase blood flow. The use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections to encourage nutrient delivery to the scalp is also discussed, although there is insufficient clinical data to support it as a treatment. The transcript cautions against confusing PRP with stem cell injections and notes that the success of PRP injections may be independent of the platelets.

Botox is being used to try and offset hair loss by decreasing the tensile nature of the scalp skin so that more blood flow can arrive at that stem cell follicle area. The combination of microneedling and minoxidil treatment is more effective in recovering Dead zones compared to treatments alone. Minoxidil treatment likely needs to be done for life if one wants to hold on to hair growth. Element is an electrolyte drink that contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio of sodium, potassium, and magnesium.

The section discusses the use of Botox injections for hair loss treatment and the chemical factors that affect hair growth. Key points include:
  *Botox injections can reduce scalp tension and improve hair growth, but repeated injections are necessary for efficacy.
  *There are few clinical studies on the use of Botox for hair loss, but it appears to be a safe alternative to minoxidil.
  *Cuttis verticus gyrata is a scalp condition that is associated with hair loss and can be treated with Botox injections.
  *Insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and cyclic AMP are key factors that accelerate hair growth by extending the antigen phase.
  *Phosphodiesterase (PDE) and TGF beta 2 are factors that act as brakes on hair growth by shortening the antigen phase or extending the catagen phase.
  *Androgen-related alopecia, induced by testosterone and its derivatives, is the most common cause of hair loss in both men and women.
  *Testosterone levels decline with age, but older men can still have similar levels to younger men.
  *Women have higher levels of testosterone than estrogen, but lower levels than most men.
The section discusses the relationship between dihydrotestosterone, androgen receptors, and hair loss. It explains why people lose hair in certain regions and the genetics behind it. It also explores the use of caffeine as a treatment for hair loss.
  *Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) inhibits hair growth by reducing igf-1 and cyclic amp.
  *Testosterone is converted to DHT by an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase.
  *Pattern hair loss is Androgen dependent alopecia.
  *The pattern of Androgen receptors on the scalp differs among individuals, and it is inherited from the mother's side.
  *Androgen receptors on the face stimulate beard growth.
  *Caffeine is a potent PDE inhibitor, which indirectly stimulates igf-1, and can suppress hair loss and stimulate hair growth.
  *Topical caffeine application can be as effective as minoxidil application in treating hair loss.
The section discusses the use of topical caffeine ointments as a potential treatment for hair loss. Caffeine is shown to stimulate hair growth and prevent hair loss by reducing cell death in stem cell niches. Oral caffeine intake is not effective in stimulating hair growth due to limited concentration in the scalp. Prescription drugs like growth hormone and sermorelin can also increase hair growth, but they have side effects.

The section discusses how certain treatments can increase hair growth and skin health, but they come with risks such as increased cancer risk. Insulin sensitivity and iron levels also play a role in hair growth. Dihydrotestosterone can shorten the hair growth phase and miniaturize hair follicles, but reducing 5-alpha reductase can prevent this. There are supplements and prescription treatments available to improve insulin sensitivity and iron levels.
  *Certain treatments can increase hair growth and improve skin health.

  *Reducing 5-alpha reductase can prevent the negative effects of dihydrotestosterone.
  *Supplements and prescription treatments can improve insulin sensitivity and iron levels.
The section discusses the use of Saw Palmetto and Ketoconazole to offset hair loss and stimulate hair growth. Saw Palmetto inhibits 5-alpha reductase weakly and is known to have few side effects. Taking 300mg of Saw Palmetto per day can help maintain hair growth. The effectiveness of herbal compounds for hair growth is difficult to prove due to the many variables involved. Ketoconazole is an anti-fungal that was initially developed to treat dandruff and psoriasis. It can increase hair number and diameter despite its common side effect of drying and thinning hair.

that more blood flow can arrive at that stem cell follicle area. the combination of microneedling and minoxidil treatment is more effective in recovering dead zone compared to treatment alone.

that contains a science backed electrolyte ratio of sodium, potassium, and magnesium the section discus the use of book injection for hair loss treatment and the chemical factor that affect hair growth. key point include: *book injection can reduce scalp tension and improve hair growth, but repeated injection are necessary for efficacy. *there are few clinical study on the use of book for hair loss, but it appears to be a safe alternative to minoxidil. *curtis vertex stratum is a scalp condition that is associated with hair loss and can be treated with book injections. *insulin growth factor 1 (if 1) and cyclic amp are key factor that accelerate hair growth by extending the antigen phase. *phosphodiesterase (pde) and gf beta 2 are factor that act a brake on hair growth by shortening the antigen phase or extending the cathen phase. *androgen related alopecia, induced by testosterone and it derivatives, is the most common because of hair loss in both men and women. *testosterone level decline with age, but older men can still have similar level to younger men. *women have higher level of testosterone than estrogen, but lower level than most men. the section discus the relationship between dihydrotestosterone, androgen receptors, and hair loss. it explains why people lose hair in certain region and the genetics behind it. it also explores the use of caffeine a a treatment for hair loss. *dihydrotestosterone (dot) inhibits hair growth by reducing if 1 and cyclic amp. *testosterone is converted to dot by an enzyme called 5 alpha reductase. *pattern hair loss is androgen dependent alopecia. *the pattern of androgen receptor on the scalp differs among individuals, and it is inherited from the mother's side. *androgen receptor on the face stimulate beard growth. *caffeine is a potent pde inhibitor, which indirectly stimulates if 1, and can suppress hair loss and stimulate hair growth. *topical caffeine application can be a effective a minoxidil application in treating hair loss. the section discus the use of topical caffeine ornament a a potential treatment for hair loss. caffeine is shown to stimulate hair growth and prevent hair loss by reducing cell death in stem cell niches. oral caffeine intake is not effective in stimulating hair growth due to limited concentration in the scalp. prescription drug like growth hormone and sermorelin can also increase hair growth, but they have side effects. *topical caffeine ornament are a potential treatment for hair loss *caffeine stimulates hair growth and prevents hair loss *oral

2782,2782,"Chronology some comments because they doesn‚Äôt seem right to me:
1. There is no DHT receptor; all Androgens and estrogens can bound to it. People with high duasteride do have hairloss while DHT are zero when taking DHEA. If at all, it‚Äôs a ‚Äûreceptor‚Äú which has a broad range.
2. Hairloss starts after puberty, not after 30 or somewhat. It‚Äôs just depends how fast you you lose hair to notice, and noticing itself is of course subjectively. 
3. I dont know any male who has not hairloss especially under stressed times (in military literally everybody has hairloss) but since we were shaved a lot didn‚Äôt notice until others told them
4. Hairloss, especially mpb, is not only a hair problem, it‚Äôs a skin problem primary. I think it‚Äôs a way too far to talk about stem cells. When the skin is inflammed hair loss will occur. 
5. it‚Äôs true that Sebum is anti bacterial, but sebum is a paradise for Fungi, it‚Äôs btw a huge missing part in the whole hairloss topic because fungi do inflame skin, and it‚Äôs possible explanation for acne too. Therefore androgens role can be understand better because no androgen=no sebum=no fungi=no hairloss/Acne. Keep just in mind.
6. I‚Äôm not the opinion that blood flow is not the solution alone, I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs the solution for mpb. Since i do breathing exercises my hair is perfect, thats carbon dioxide, vasodilating. It‚Äôs like minoxidil without side effects. 
7. It‚Äôs hilarious because He describes perfectly that the Anagen phase is anabolic and so on, but the whole hair hemisphere dismis the fact that adrogens are anabolic and Cortisol is catabolic. Every biologist should know that androgens and Cortisol compete for the ‚Äûreceptor‚Äú but androgens are the blame instead of Cortisol. Just think about it‚Ä¶ and references to ‚Äûdon‚Äôt stress because your hair will fall out‚Ä¶‚Äú
8. NO, DHT does not cause Hairloss, there is no evidence for that. Myself used DHT right to my hair and my hair grew thicker and stronger, but no regrow, whatsoever no additional hairloss. The same was done to mice, DHT increases hair density. Sorry Prof but that claim isn‚Äôt scientifically back up, it‚Äôs at best a hypothesis which lays there for more than 70 years and brought us nowhere. Dislike
9. Everywhere in the Body eher Eid a state of hypoxia(no oxygen) the is in increase in DHT because 5AR needs oxygen. Again, no support for the DHT Hypothesis.
10. Minoxidil turns on NO, and Nitric Oxide makes vasodilation possible, but doesn‚Äôt turn it on necessarily (fe no carbon dioxide=no vasodilation)
11. Microneedling he also another Factor: it allows the skin to heal better because in most cases the area without hair is fibrotic (scar tissue) and when there is scar tissue no hair will grow. It‚Äôs often dismiss that even if you would completely cure the root cause of your hairloss the fibrotic tissue wouldn‚Äôt allow to regrow hair. So removing the fibrosis is essential to regrow hair. Btw: why is the tissue fibrotic in the First place and bald people has this shiny head liked polish? That‚Äôs inflammation. I hope you have some lightbulb moments here and there
12. the Botox aspect‚Äôs kinda proves that even breathing exercises will help hairloss. Botox relaxes the muscle around the head, probably stress restrict due to tense muscle the blood flow. Stay üòé
13. it‚Äôs interesting because IGF-1 is increased trough androgens‚Ä¶ but androgens again are the blame. Androgens makes most, maybe all hair, grow expect for the upper part of the head. The hypothesis is üí© 
14. TGF Beta 2 is increased everywhere where is inflammation‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not exclusive to hair loss, and that‚Äôs the another reason why the whole DHT hypothesis is false.
15. NO, the so called ‚Äûandrogentic ankleckert doesn‚Äôt start at 50 or so, it‚Äôs starts right after puberty‚Äú
No, it‚Äôs not true 1:09:59

16. 1:12:58 Ah, so older people, for whatever reason have higher enzyme activity but doesn‚Äôt experience all the insanely good effect of DHT the Prof just mentioned earlier (high Libido, strength etc etc) ??? I think people should latest start here to asked more questions because obviously here is something wrong. For my personal, I say that with age carbon dioxide and oxygen do work less efficiently and when there no oxygen than 5AR is active in tissue where the hypoxia is located. Obviously it‚Äôs not systemic in term like ‚Äûyou got older and 5AR is now higher so you have hairloss etc). Btw Baby‚Äôs habe mpb in most cases Prof. It‚Äôs a huge missing point and at least my View purely false to say so how you did (with needed respect to talk like that, I like Huberman Lab)
1:14:15 
Probably not. It‚Äôs well documented that the areas with no hair/hair loss have less blow flow, and so less oxygen and so logically more DHT because of disturbed enzyme activity.  Saying it‚Äôs the androgen receptor while is actually quit proven that the areas are in hypoxic state doesn‚Äôt sound logically to me, probably because it‚Äôs kinda stupid.

1:25:03 
What I miss is, that there is only a talk about insulin effectiveness, but rarely the talk is about insulin itself. Skinny guys, low weight people, people on diets etc have lower insulin due to lack of carbohydrates, and this mimics features of diabetes. It doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense to talk about insulin resistance when there is no insulin in the first place. That was off topic, but worthy to mention.

1:27:44 Evidence?
1:28:01 Evidence?
1:39:07  No‚Ä¶.
Finasteride is created in Frankenstein manner from progesterone‚Ä¶
1:45:20 
Yes, it‚Äôs horrific. Pharma still sells 1mg tablets of Finasteride, but 0.1mg is is much safer and same effective. Pharma again is hanging in the last century.","chronology some comment because they doesn t seem right to me: 1. there is no dot receptor all androgen and estrogen can bound to it. people with high duasteride do have hairless while dot are zero when taking dhe. if at all, it s a receptor which ha a broad range. 2. hairless start after puberty, not after 30 or somewhat. it s just depends how fast you you lose hair to notice, and noticing itself is of course subjective. 3. i do not know any male who ha not hairless especially under stressed time (in military literally everybody ha hairless) but since we were shaved a lot didn t notice until others told them 4. hairless, especially mp, is not only a hair problem, it s a skin problem primary. i think it s a way too far to talk about stem cells. when the skin is inflamed hair loss will occur. 5. it s true that serum is anti bacterial, but serum is a paradise for fungi, it s by the way a huge missing part in the whole hairless topic because fungi do inflamed skin, and it s possible explanation for acne too. therefore androgen role can be understand better because no androgen no serum no fungi no hairless acne. keep just in mind. 6. i m not the opinion that blood flow is not the solution alone, i m pretty sure it s the solution for mp. since i do breathing exercise my hair is perfect, that is carbon dioxide, vasodilating. it s like minoxidil without side effects. 7. it s hilarious because he describes perfectly that the manager phase is anabolic and so on, but the whole hair hemisphere dismiss the fact that androgen are anabolic and cortical is catholic. every biologist should know that androgen and cortical compete for the receptor but androgen are the blame instead of cortical. just think about it and reference to don t stress because your hair will fall out 8. no, dot doe not because hairless, there is no evidence for that. myself used dot right to my hair and my hair grew thicker and stronger, but no region, whatsoever no additional hairless. the same wa done to mice, dot increase hair density. sorry prof but that claim isn t scientifically back up, it s at best a hypothesis which lay there for more than 70 year and brought u nowhere. dislike 9. everywhere in the body her eid a state of hypoxia(no oxygen) the is in increase in dot because 5ar need oxygen. again, no support for the dot hypothesis. 10. minoxidil turn on no, and nitric oxide make vasodilation possible, but doesn t turn it on necessarily (fe no carbon dioxide no vasodilation) 11. microneedling he also another factor: it allows the skin to heal better because in most case the area without hair is fibrosis (scar tissue) and when there is scar tissue no hair will grow. it s often dismiss that even if you would completely cure the root because of your hairless the fibrosis tissue wouldn t allow to region hair. so removing the fibrosis is essential to region hair. by the way: why is the tissue fibrosis in the first place and bald people ha this shiny head liked polish that s inflammation. i hope you have some lightblue moment here and there 12. the book aspect s kind of prof that even breathing exercise will help hairless. book relates the muscle around the head, probably stress restrict due to tense muscle the blood flow. stay 13. it s interesting because if 1 is increased trough androgen but androgen again are the blame. androgen make most, maybe all hair, grow expect for the upper part of the head. the hypothesis is 14. gf beta 2 is increased everywhere where is inflammation it s not exclusive to hair loss, and that s the another reason why the whole dot hypothesis is false. 15. no, the so called androgentic ankleckert doesn t start at 50 or so, it s start right after puberty no, it s not true 9 16. 128 ah, so older people, for whatever reason have higher enzyme activity but doesn t experience all the instantly good effect of dot the prof just mentioned earlier (high libro, strength etc etc)

3039,3039,"¬†@Les Vegetables¬† This is a good overview. Some points of nuance I would add are:

- Take 1mg of finasteride for one year before adding anything else. Finasteride takes about 8-12 months to see the full results of, and can even continue to show better results after years 2, 3, and 4 for people who get on it early into their hair loss.

- Do no use micro-needling without minoxidil. There isn‚Äôt good evidence that micro-needling works on its own to regrow hair. The reason it‚Äôs suggested as a pairing with minoxidil is because it‚Äôs believed that the micro-needling allows the minoxidil to reach the bulb of the hair follicle and have its effect. However, there are other ways to achieve this such as oral minoxidil.

- Only use minoxidil as a last ditch effort. It doesn‚Äôt prevent hair loss, like finasteride does, and its side effect profile is worse than most people realize, and it‚Äôs only a band-aid solution to hair loss.

- Always introduce new therapies one at a time and give them the appropriate amount of time to see results. Take lots of before and after pictures in the same conditions. You want to know where you‚Äôre getting the most bang for your buck, so to speak, because using the least amount of treatment possible maximizes that risk-reward ratio.

And here is my answer :

I plan on switching from the combinaison therapy finasteride + dutasteride to dutasteride only.

3060,3060,"‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã¬†@Namikaze Omar¬† I would say that's a great idea . Also keep in mind that finasteride gets its "" best result "" at month 24 so 2 years after starting . Which means you results could come up later.

And also keep in mind that "" keeping what you have "" in terms of hair count is already a win for finasteride users . My point is : don't expect regrowth from finasteride. Cause maintenance is what's going to happen with finasteride (your main goal is to stop the hairloss, not to regrow what you lost).

However, if you feel like you are not maintaining your ground on finasteride then i would definitely add both topical minoxidil 5%  (apply once a day, it's enough) and dutasteride twice a week on top of finasteride for another year. If you still lose ground in 1 year ? Then I would completely switch over to dutasteride 0.5mg everyday while using topical minoxidil 5% as well. 

Hope it helps üôè. 

Ps : you might actually get some regrowth with dutasteride everyday + minoxidil 5% but keep in mind that you might go throught a HUGE shedding phase before getting those regrowth (it will basically get worse before it gets better) but you know that's how the hair cycle works. So a big shedding of your hair at the beginning of the treatment is actually a good thing (it shows the treatment is working). Everything you shed is gonna grown back thicker later !","amikaze omar i would say that is a great idea . also keep in mind that finasteride get it best result at month 24 so 2 year after starting . which mean you result could come up later. and also keep in mind that keeping what you have in term of hair count is already a win for finasteride user . my point is : do not expect growth from finasteride. because maintenance is what is going to happen with finasteride (your main goal is to stop the hairless, not to region what you lost). however, if you feel like you are not maintaining your ground on finasteride then i would definitely add both topical minoxidil 5% (apply once a day, it is enough) and dutasteride twice a week on top of finasteride for another year. if you still lose ground in 1 year then i would completely switch over to dutasteride 0.5mg everyday while using topical minoxidil 5% a well. hope it help . p : you might actually get some growth with dutasteride everyday + minoxidil 5% but keep in mind that you might go through a huge shedding phase before getting those growth (it will basically get worse before it get better) but you know that is how the hair cycle works. so a big shedding of your hair at the beginning of the treatment is actually a good thing (it show the treatment is working). everything you she would is going to grown back thicker later !",1683534738.684199,miscellaneous,Positive

3225,3225,"This podcast from Huberman was quite a letdown, so much mention of expensive and unnecessary products. In my experience I regained my hair by focusing on creating a healthy scalp microbiome, which meant: 1) No more use of shampoo (they are chemical disruptors and kill the microbiome). 2) Doing a weekly scalp scrub exfoliation with a mix of honey and pink sea salt. 3) Brushing my hair every day first thing in the morning and last think at night (with a wooden brush, which distributes the healthy oils and creates blood flow). 4) Some morning sun exposure to the hair. 5) When I feel some day I had sweat a lot I apply some organic apple cider vinegar (or lemon) diluted with water to the scalp and then rinse it with water. 6) Once a week some hair nutrition thing like an egg mask or a rice water mask (all this for 20 minutes). Also sometimes applying spirluna or matcha with honey to the scalp for some minutes block DHT (I usually apply it before meditating for 30 minutes after yoga 7) doing yoga, relaxing and always finishing with an 8 minute headstand (good for blood circulation to the scalp) and for being stress free. 8) Healthy eating, nothing obsessive, but considering eating red meat, green vegs, eggs and fruits. 9) Filter tap water that you drink and also very important to use a filter shower (the chlorine chemicals and other toxins are absorbed a lot by the scalp). 10) Trust your intuition and nature and understand that most of the pharma industry (it is and industry that needs perpetual clients) is designed to keep you hooked to meds for life.
