Or is it that in specific cases, like in 8 Queens Problem, it is better to use Backtracking, because it relates to a constraint, that no Queen should be able to kill the other, whereas in Traveling Salesman Problem, the main objective is to minimize the cost, under the given function, whereas there's no such cost function in the case of 8 Queens?",interrogative

"VPN is bullshit. they provide neither anonymity nor security. VPN was made to securely access a remote network. Your IP isn't as important as they make it out to be. if you want anonymity use tor. if you want to mask your ip, use a proxy (or tor). your browser sends a load of information that can be used to identify you uniquely, from the version and operating system in the user agent to screen resolution, supported ciphers and loads of other stuff. cookies can be used to track you easily. as soon as you log in they know who you are anyway. as for security... it does nothing. packets are encrypted with vpn to the vpn server and then the vpn layer is decrypted. that's not a problem since 99.5% of the internet uses TLS with AES anyway. It doesn't protect you from scams, downloading viruses or entering your credit card information on fake banking sites. Also instead of your ISP getting all of your DNS requests, the vpn server gets them (as well as all 100% of your decrypted (vpn layer only, obviously) traffic), so who do you trust more? I'd rather trust myself. If you do want your dns records secure just set up a recursive dns server. i have one running on my raspberry pi as well as my own openvpn server. and not because of the bullshit reasons vpn companies sell you but because to access my own network (printer, network storage, etc) from remote. So instead of selling that vpn snakeoil, how about you choose your sponsors more carefully. at least raid shadow legends is providing a game, however shitty, instead of taking your money for nothing except for a slower internet connection and potential security risk. And yes, using VPN is a security risk. You're literally plugging a (virtual) lan cable into their vpn server, bypassing any and all protection layers like your router's NAS firewall and IDS and instead rely on theirs. I can connect to my home VPN server all I want because I know it's secure and it has snort ids set up (on the raspberry), pi hole (on the pi), my nextcloud storage and webserver (on the pi), the recursive dns server (on the pi), etc. So literally buy a raspberry pi for 40 bucks and you get more value out of it than all the fucking vpn salesmen in the world. and even if you don't you don't get anything. vpn providers have a place, but it's not like everybody needs it or their data gets stolen by hackers. that's not how hacking works, or vpn. you go to a malicious website that exploits some vulnerability in your browser or execute a virus or run an vulnerable service like a game server or something and the hacker just gets the data through the vpn tunnel just like anything else. The best defense is not vpn, it's brain.exe running properly. and that includes not buying this bullshit. so stop promoting it. please. PS: also just because raid shadow legends is better than vpn... please do not promote that garbage either. and although i'm sick of hearing it, audibile and brilliant at least offer something sensible. PPS: Just for promoting this garbage i'm gonna vote down. although I know that still counts as interaction and youtube doesn't care.",negative

"To the person who is reading this, you are very precious and valuable even if you don't feel so. Jesus loves you ❤ He paid a price on the cross for you. He rose on the third day and defeated death. He took the punishment in our place. He did this out of his inconceivable love for us. He can revive your situation no matter how messed up it is. Don't end your life at any point. There is hope in Jesus. He is able to deliver you from sins. He is able to take away your depression, loneliness and suicidal thoughts etc., He is able to heal your sickness and disease. You just have to humble yourself and call out to him ""wholeheartedly"" and he will answer you. He set me free from porn addiction and masturbation in 2018 which I struggled with for almost 10 years. I was close to death three times and he saved me. He changed my lustful heart. He can transform your life if you let him. You just have to repent from your sins and transfer your trust from yourself to Jesus. He will give you the peace which surpasses all understanding, even in the midst of trials and tribulations. Fear won't grip you anymore because you will receive the assurance of eternal life when you believe in Jesus. He is the only way to heaven. He paid our fine by shedding his sinless blood for our sins. Our good works cannot get us to heaven. Those are like a bribe to the judge of the universe. This is a very serious thing. We never know when our last minute on earth is. It could be any second, hour or day from now and if we don't have forgiveness for our sins, we will end up in Hell. We cannot take our money, riches or fame with us when we die. We have to give an account of our life to God. We only have chance till we are alive on this earth. Please think about this. Don't let pride stop you from knowing the truth. I was prideful before and rebelled against the living God and forsook the truth just because I didn't want to lose. Humble yourself and call on to Jesus from wherever you are and ask him ""sincerely"" if all these things are true and he will reveal it to you. He will open your heart to the truth. You can experience him personally if you try it. You won't lose anything. Jesus is coming soon. If we have not repented from our sins and turned to him, we will end up in hell. This is not a religion. This is a relationship with God. I am telling all this because I care for you. Even though I don't know you personally, I know that your soul is extremely precious to God. The reason I am posting it here is because we never know when our last moments are. It could be anytime from now and I don't want you to end up in hell. Jesus is the only one who can save you from your sins and grant you everlasting life, after life on earth ends. May Jesus reveal himself to you. God bless you. Take care.",positive

"Business Opportunity in Ruvol I have invented a Board Game [still unpublished and not yet out in the market] that I believe is guaranteed to be as challenging and exciting as CHESS.  I called it “RUVOL.”   It is my hope that one day Ruvol may surpass chess as the “Number One Board Game in the World.”  The weakness of chess is it always starts in fixed positions that the opening moves become “memorizable.”  In fact, not a few have so mastered the moves that they can play against their opponents “blindfolded.”  It is for this very reason that the great Bobby Fischer introduced his so-called “Fischer Random Chess,” where the starting position of the pieces is “randomized” to make the memorization of openings impracticable.  Fortunately, it is also for this reason that I invented Ruvol where “every game” has been calculated to be a challenging one to play. HOW IS RUVOL PLAYED and HOW YOU CAN MONETIZE IT?  I detailed everything in my YouTube video.  Here is the link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcqth0m3-R0  BIG MONEY POTENTIAL IN RUVOL!  It is worthwhile to note that the people who play chess will be the same people who will play Ruvol.  In my Google search, I learned there are around 800 million chess players in the world.  Even just a small percentage of these 800 million is good enough to earn big money from Ruvol either as an ONLINE GAME BUSINESS or as a PHYSICAL PRODUCT DISTRIBUTOR.

In addition, I'm somewhat confused because it produces a binary/categorical result (0 or 1) instead of a numeric result that can have a range of values.Also, how can we confirm that the relationship is linear, especially if we're using categories to produce the results instead of a range of values?Let me know if that didn't make sense.

Tim didnt even mention the term classification and he even used LinearClassifier which is probably used for classification as name implies. really in doubt how an ML expert like Tim would forget such a fundamental thing .   That really sets bad intuition for beginners and they would get confused when they get to know what both of these terms actually mean.  thats enough to decide that this video is not a video to watch especially for beginners.

Similarly , when extracting features at higher dimensions can yield to better features. I hope it helps :)",miscellaneous

I thought your course was excellent a perfect mix of hand holding giving a great overview and good level of detail in the right places.I've no idea how long it took you to create it - but it took me three long days to watch it, back-up re-watch etc but I truly got a huge amount of value from it so a BIG THANK-YOU and I highly recommend it as a very informative starting point for anyone new to ML.

Unless you manually reset the graph, you'll be training for the sum of all epochs you used the fit function (like 10 + 8 + 1 epochs) To avoid this problem you should use something like keras.backend.clear_session() or tf.reset_default_graph() between tests with hyperparameters 😉",miscellaneous

Or if you encode cities you may end up with values 1- NYC 2- LA 3-WAS and it would mean that Washington value is 3 times of NYC. I think how it is really done in the engine is that you introduce separate column for each category value. Sor for sex you would get two columns: Female and Male with boolean values. If it is female then Female column is equal 1 and male 0. You can do same with cities. If we have only three cities then there would three extra columns with boolean values indicating which city it was.",corrective

"Although I can appreciate the amount of content in this video, I must point out for the beginners here that some of the explanations in the video are not correct. I am currently at 2:03:08 and so far I have noticed two main things:  at 1:11:05 he explained that in linear regression in 3d space, assuming a linear relationship, you try to use two variables to predict the value of the third. This is true, but the model is then not a straight line pointing somewhere in 3d space, but a 2d plane. Such false information gives beginners a bad intuition for these things.   Furthermore, the whole Titanic survival prediction section was a classification task, so it had little to do with linear regression. He used the LinearClassifier object, which (probably) runs a logistic regression in the background. In the output dictionary, there were keys that are typical for the output of a logistic regression. Although linear regression and logistic regression are both algorithms that create models that assume a linear relationship between input variables, they are completely different algorithms. I would have liked to see a clear distinction between regression and classification problems here, because these are fundamental concepts in ML and the video wrongly conveys that you solve a regression problem by predicting whether a passenger survives or not.  edit: His intuitive explanation at 3:09:13 of what activation functions do is just wrong. The sigmoid function does not project the data points into higher dimensional space, quite the opposite, actually. The sigmoid function is defined as f: R^n -> [0,1], so it takes as input an n-dimensional vector and it yields a scalar (fancy word for a single number). This whole ""projection into higher dimensional space"" thing is known as the Kernel trick and is NOT used in his examples, it's something completely different. Activation functions are used in Neural Networks because they introduce non-linearity which you need because otherwise your Neural Network would just be a linear classifier so it would basically do one big weighted summation of the inputs. This is not enough to capture complicated relationships in data. With non-linearity introduced, it can be shown that a Neural Network can approximate any function with arbitrary accuracy, that is any function that might have generated the data. Read up on the universal approximation theorem, if you want to learn more.  edit 2: 3:36:15 You don't evaluate on your test data multiple times to select the best set of hyperparameters. That way, you overfit your test data. A cleaner approach would be to split the data into three sets: the training set, the validation set and the test set. Prior to training you define a few selections of hyperparameters you want to select the best from before you train all these models on the training data. You then evaluate the performance of each model on the validation data. Finally, you select the best performing model and test it on the test data to get a final estimate of the model's performance on completely new data points. There are more sophisticated approaches to do hyperparameter tuning but this is the basic idea.",corrective

It's when you're afraid to use casual phrases or slang words you've picked up from TV or books in your response and you start to slow down. That's a real one problem to be stuck with inventing something ahah while recording. So hard to get rid of it.

There's no academic language proof of that is the use informal expressions like wanna, gonna, kind of, you know, etc.  I work all days for hours with a number of customers of Google and that's exactly how we sound all days. My big question is pretty much regarding the fact that we need to be formal and discuss academic questions in a test. Let's say your career prospects, short and long term objectives. Imagine we're talking with the ambassador of the UK and we have to convince him with our fully professional answers. Share your comments about this last point of mine.",imperative

"Thank you for distributing all these information! I tried to figure out by myself, but I'm not sure, so I would like to ask you. I'm not a very decision-friendly person in general and it often happens to me, that I like both sides or need more time than ""normal humans"" to decide for one. I often read in the TOEFL Guide that ""there is no right and wrong"", but then again - you must answer. Is it  a problem, when I do agree with two opposites and explain pros and cons in order to explain, why it is hard for me to decide? Concerning Speaking and Writing questions. Thanks in advance!",positive
"Hi Josh, this comment might be very similar to some comments here but I just wanted to express my gratitude. I watched your videos just one week before the test. They did boost my confidence a lot. Eventually, I got 117 (with 28 on Speaking, which I had only got 20 in the previous time). Thank you so much!P/S: in my opinion, the most special things in your videos are your jokes and laughs. We all know that preparing for a test is very stressful but your teaching style helped me get over most of the unnecessary stress while still gain the crucial knowledge.

"If you are PREPARING for the TOEFL please read the ENTIRE comment: I'm an English teacher looking to start teaching  and helping YOU  with the TOEFL. I'm experienced teaching online, but do not have a lot of experience teaching TOEFL.   I would like to improve my teaching skills by helping one of YOU! If anyone is interested, the idea is this:  ---- 6 classes of 30 minutes each (or more, depending on the day and my schedule).  ---- ONE dollar PER 30 minute class. (The reason is to make sure that students who aren't serious are filtered out. Will not change this requirement.)   What you get: ---- (almost!) Free ONE-on-ONE TOEFL training with a native English teacher. (I will make sure I help you as best as I can.)   What I get: ---- A chance to learn and improve in teaching the TOEFL.        I want to know that the student is truly serious about this, so, if interested, answer in the comments:   1. What is your motivation for taking the TOEFL? What goals will getting your desired TOEFL score help you achieve? 2. What are some of the biggest challenges that you're facing in preparing for the TOEFL? 3. What test score do you need to get on the TOEFL? 4. Any more information you would like to share?     I will choose ONE person to work with at first. Maybe later I will choose another. We'll talk about scheduling once I choose you. Hope to hear from you. I will be posting on different videos.   (I apologize to the uploader if this is seen as bothersome.

"Hi Mosh,  Your way of teaching is very beautiful. Keep creating such videos. I just want to point out one mistake in this video which I found while practicing the code. In your Arrays section,  in ""removeAt(int index)""  method you have used for a loop as ,   for (int i = index;  i < count;  i++){     items[i] = items[i+1]; }     which will not work if you add 6 elements in the array and remove the last element from it.  eg. in the Main class if you write :               array.insert(5);         array.insert(53);         array.insert(50);         array.insert(56);         array.insert(57);         array.insert(58);         array.removeAt(5);   Then, your code will give ""ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException"" (As the array is full and the count variable has been initialized to '6' and inside for loop you are trying to shift element at 6th index to 5th index. But at the 6th index element is not present, because the array is up to 5th index only).   If we replace that code with the below code it will work for all the cases.                    for (int i = index; i < count-1; i++) {                       items[i] = items[i+1];            }",corrective

"To the person reading this, you are precious and valuable even if you don't feel like it. Jesus loves you ❤ He paid a price on the cross for you. He rose on the third day and defeated death. He took the punishment in our place. He did this out of his inconceivable love for us. He can revive your situation no matter how messed up it is. Don't end your life at any point. There is hope in Jesus. He is able to deliver you from sins. He is able to take away your depression, loneliness and suicidal thoughts etc., He is able to heal your sickness and disease. You just have to humble yourself and call out to him ""wholeheartedly"" and he will answer you. He set me free from porn addiction and masturbation in 2018 which I struggled with for almost 10 years. I was close to death three times and he saved me. He changed my lustful heart. He can transform your life if you let him. You just have to repent from your sins and transfer your trust from yourself to Jesus. He will give you the peace which surpasses all understanding, even in the midst of trials and tribulations. Fear won't grip you anymore because you will receive the assurance of eternal life when you believe in Jesus. He is the only way to heaven. He paid our fine by shedding his sinless blood for our sins. Our good works cannot get us to heaven. Those are like a bribe to the judge of the universe. This is a very serious thing. We never know when our last minute on earth is. It could be any second, hour or day from now and if we don't have forgiveness for our sins, we will end up in Hell. We cannot take our money, riches or fame with us when we die. We have to give an account of our life to God. We only have chance till we are alive on this earth. Please think about this. Don't let pride stop you from knowing the truth. I was prideful before and rebelled against the living God and forsook the truth just because I didn't want to lose. Humble yourself and call on to Jesus from wherever you are and ask him ""sincerely"" if all these things are true and he will reveal it to you. He will open your heart to the truth. You can experience him personally if you try it. You won't lose anything. Jesus is coming soon. If we have not repented from our sins and turned to him, we will end up in hell. This is not a religion. This is a relationship with God. I am telling all this because I care for you. Even though I don't know you personally, I know that your soul is extremely precious to God. The reason I am posting it here is because we never know when our last moments are. It could be anytime from now and I don't want you to end up in hell. Jesus is the only one who can save you from your sins and grant you everlasting life, after life on earth ends. May Jesus reveal himself to you. God bless you. Take care!",positive

"I have a very specific question regarding plotting. I have a model that returns an output in csv. the data is sorted in the following way (Just an example): It has three columns: Technology Price Year  Each of the technology names just continue down in the same column, just changing names when a new technology is represented. The years are for a 20 year period, but if a technology does not have a price in a given year, that row is not displayed. So some technologies appear 20 times with 20 prices, other maybe 15 times with 15 prices.  Example: Technology Price Year BMW 56000 1997 BMW 57000 1998 BMW 56500 1999 AUDI 47500 1997 AUDI 49000 1999 etc.  How can I plot all the technologies together (BMW, AUDI, MERCEDES etc..) with their prices in one graph with the years 1997-2017 for example? So that they are correctly displayed even if AUDI does not have a value for 1998 for example.  I have tried a lot with pandas and stuff but I can't seem to make it work.

Because as a costumer, you have to buy a whole set of cartridge even though you cannot use its whole capacity. For example, for Susan, to calculate the print cost if using Zero, you should at least buy 1 Zero Toner set (which capacity is 11,000 pages) for Susan 2 years’ print (7,800 pages =2*52*5*15), which cost $370 instead of $262.36 (=370/11,000*7,800). hope get your reply.",interrogative

"Business Opportunity in Ruvol  I have invented a Board Game [still unpublished and not yet out in the market] that I believe is guaranteed to be as challenging and exciting as CHESS.  I called it “RUVOL.”    It is my hope that one day Ruvol may surpass chess as the “Number One Board Game in the World.”   The weakness of chess is it always starts in fixed positions that the opening moves become “memorizable.”  In fact, not a few have so mastered the moves that they can play against their opponents “blindfolded.”  It is for this very reason that the great Bobby Fischer introduced his so-called “Fischer Random Chess,” where the starting position of the pieces is “randomized” to make the memorization of openings impracticable.  Fortunately, it is also for this reason that I invented Ruvol where “every game” has been calculated to be a challenging one to play.  HOW IS RUVOL PLAYED and HOW YOU CAN MONETIZE IT?  I detailed everything in my YouTube video.  Here is the link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcqth0m3-R0  BIG MONEY POTENTIAL IN RUVOL!  It is worthwhile to note that the people who play chess will be the same people who will play Ruvol.  In my Google search, I learned there are around 800 million chess players in the world.  Even just a small percentage of these 800 million is good enough to earn big money from Ruvol either as an ONLINE GAME BUSINESS or as a PHYSICAL PRODUCT DISTRIBUTOR.  You may contact me at:  rodolfovitangcol@gmail.com.     Thanks and God bless!   RODOLFO MARTIN VITANGCOL The Ruvol Inventor",positive

"The cameras on the S21U are sub-par for the spec as DXO Mark suggests with their forensic analysis. So, I suspect the OP9P matches or beats it.   As for battery life, saying the s21U kills it, what is the proof? Since the updates, I have seen 7h+ on the OP9P and it now comes very close to matching the S21U mah for mAh!  Checking out Speedtest G and it is clear the OP9P beats out the Exynos s21U by a good margin, maybe a generational difference and even the SD888 wins comfortably. It is clear the OP9P is the best in performance.  Pricewise, the US market is not a good guide as in most other countries the OP9P falls between the s21 and s21+ in pricing and the S21U is £350 more retail so easy win for OP9P.  Hard to buy the s21U without a big discount, but again that mainly happens in the US where Samsung is trying to destroy the competition with deals. In the UK we get the odd flash sale but give it two months and the OP9P will also get these discounts. So unless you are a hardcore Samsung, the OP9P is the def value choice out of the two.",miscellaneous
"I’m using the 9 pro from over 2 weeks and I am absolutely loving it 😍 there was a minimal heating issue but now it’s almost gone with the third update in my unit and the phone runs ultra smooth. Battery life also increased with the update now and camera’s improved 😍😍 overall no issue except these but they are gone with updates so I’m extremely happy buying the 9 pro. Comparison to s21 ultra or iPhone 12 pro with 9 pro (for us Indians) is stupid 😂😂 as the 9 pro is 40k-45k (almost $750) cheaper 😂😂😂 then s21ultra or 55k ($900) cheap then iPhone 12 Pro, I could go and return from Bangkok in that 😂 for s21 and South Korea for iPhone 12 Pro 😂😂😂😂",miscellaneous

"I don't understand the conclusion that One UI is somehow subpar to Oxygen OS, they both use similar design languages, in terms of actual UI simplicity and minimalism they are similar. Also, why does fast charging matter, as long as the phone is able to last you through the day, then the fact that your phone can charge up to 100% in 30 minutes doesn't really matter, if the phone could charge up to 100% in like 5-10 minutes then it would matter, but 30 minutes doesn't really change much, in my opinion anyway.",miscellaneous

"As an introduction of the pillars of OOP is clear, concise and well explained. I would remark also, it could be nice to follow Java conventions if we use Java, and to avoid encapsulation bad practices  for those are starting with OOP.   A method started with Uppercase don't follow Java conventions. A getter used to not ""get"" but ""print"" doesn't follow ""naming"" best practices. An object using a setter method which allows external object to change the internal state of the target object is a bad practice for encapsulation.  Anyway, I hope this video can help people who is starting in software development to understand the beauty of OOP.",imperative

"soo, i really like python. Its cuz the syntax is simple and you can use the class keyword for grouping functions or actually creating instances of that class. But, what i like about C# for example (which is the case for many other languages too) is that you can give multiple constructors unlike in python. Lets say you have a screen class again. now, you could create it using the width and height. But if you buy a phone, often only the aspect ratio and "" numbers r given. soo, you could give it a Vector structor, or a number in inches and a string or tuple, representing an aspect ratio. No matter what you pass in, it creates successfully, without checking for a min amount and combinations of information being given or any funky crap like that.",positive

"I wish my teacher showed us this vid, or at least explained the stuff in it, not for me but for the other students He only taught us how, not why.  My favorite OOP language is Java, but if I knew how to do it in Python that would probably be my favorite. I do like creating utterly unreadable nonsense in Java though, placing random line breaks, spaces, random comments in the middle of code, etc...  I remember watching a video about how bad OOP is, before learning what it is. Now that I really know what it's about, I can see that that video was the bad one lol. They brought up a lot of good points, but they really didn't seem to understand why those points didn't work. They said that encapsulation is useless, because you're going to make setters and getters anyway. for a lot of the time that is true, but if your object/class has a lot of complicated mechanisms, fragile balances, and/or redundant data, you don't want someone messing with those and causing issues.",imperative

"It might just be me, but I've found that the terminology used to teach OOP increases the confusion of learners. I might take things more literally than others, but when I see ""parent class / child class""  I think that the child class is subservient or less effective than the class it inherits from. So before I even start coding I view OOP as a hierarchy of classes and wonder why I should ever bother with writing classes if I can just use a few separate functions instead. Java's classB extends classA is the best terminology to use, I think.  The core complaint I have is a recent one: OOP only begins to make sense architecturally when you are operating at scale and have some understanding of WHY OOP was invented in the first place. If you don't know what problem it was invented to solve in software engineering, then you're limited in how much you can understand it. If you didn't have OOP and relied on functions interacting on data then eventually you'd stop scaling due to cognitive overhead or architectural limitations.  The best lesson I've found on OOP was a talk by one of Python's core developers, Raymond Hettinger. Raymond gives the background for WHY objects and classes exist in the first place. Link -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8moWQ1561FY  OOP was invented because of problems with software engineering in the 1980s. After viewing his talk and understanding the problems coders had with scaling their apps while keeping them maintainable, it starts to make a lot more sense. OOP makes your programming language itself more scalable so you can easily manage the increasing complexity of your app, and if you are a newbie joining a team, if they use OOP it's a LOT easier to get up-to-speed adding code to their codebase.   After watching Raymond's talk, I view OOP as a gift from the coding nightmares those teams faced. We have much more sophisticated tooling and techniques to create very advanced apps in small teams. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and the like were ONLY POSSIBLE DUE TO OOP  Before OOP, you used to have to read enormous books to understand all of the data and functions in a codebase, and then you spend months learning which functions could be used on what kinds of data. And if you used the wrong one you might introduce a bug and bring the system down. Type-checking helped somewhat but there are limitations. OOP helped fix this specific issue by introducing objects which could ONLY have certain operations performed on them. Then you start to notice functions have overlapping behaviours (i.e. add(a, b) and add_multiple(*nums) . From that origin, you can begin to see how inheritance emerges as a natural solution to that problem.   Anyway, HIGHLY recommend watching that link. It's absolute gold.",positive
"OOP is almost 40 years old now.  Same basic concepts.  Good simple concise explanation in this vid!  The only thing I'd add is that this isn't limited to real world objects as you described in the beginning of the vid.  In fact, it is probably more useful and more widespread applied to conceptual objects.  Good stuff!",positive
"Thank you Sam, I really appreciate your videos. 6:48 - I would love more explanation on that matter. I don't get things like:  Book a = new Audiobook(); Book b = a;  Animal animals [] = new Animal[2]; animals[0] = new Cat();  Audiobook a = new Book();   I don't even don't know how to look for that on Internet,. I don't expect to make a video on this, but, if you consider that this is a pattern that has a name and there are more like me in search of info about this, maybe you could approach it in one of your future videos.

My advice to anyone preparing for this section - please take the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th tips very seriously. The TOEFL reading being much less challenging than the reading comprehension of GRE can easily be done one paragraph at a time. Also you may think that reading being the first section, you won't face any disturbance but when people start their listening section 10-15 minutes before you, you can hear the passages from their headphones even if you have your headphones on. Plus this tip becomes more crucial when you are on the listening section and some people are on their speaking one which is what happened with me.",positive

"There are some objective logical flaws in these... Most strikingly: for passage 4, question 4, the answer key says C is correct: ""Most of the other students [except the girl being spoken to] understood the assigment."" But in the listening bit, the professor says at 21:49 that the girl was the ONLY person who misunderstood the assigment. Most means a majority but not all. Therefore C cannot be correct. The C option should read ""ALL of the other students"" or just ""Most of the students"" in order to be possible.",miscellaneous
"Hello, thank you for the practice test. I wanted to point out a mistake in the answer key. The answer keys says the correct answer for passage #1 Question 3 is A, but the correct is B. The audio fragment makes no mention of 'linguistics'. It is only mentioned that in order to be eligible for the trip to Guatamala, one needs to be a Spanish major. Language learning and linguistics are two completely different things, they are not at all synonymous. One can major in a language such as Spanish without learning any linguistics, and vice-versa. As such, the correct answer is B: Christy cannot go to Guatamala because the Spanish department is in charge of the program, and she is not a Spanish major.",positive

"I'm here just to ventilate my frustration... I was supposed to take my TOEFL Home Edition today but due to technical issues, I couldn't take it. I tried to solve the problem with the help of customer representatives but they couldn't do much. They referred my case and now I have to wait 5 or 7 days to receive an email with instructions on what can I do (I am not even sure if I can take the test without having to pay for it again). I paid the late fee and even didn't request special accommodation (I am a disabled person and the process of getting accommodations can take too long) because I needed to take it as soon as possible. I have been preparing for this like crazy and I just can believe this happened to me... I guess that now I have more time to watch Josh's content... right?

"This is not fair. This test isn't about English. It's about memory.

So he ""implies"" that ""It could be as dangerous as driving a car while intoxicated"" about ""dangers of sleep deprivation"", meaning ""Sleep deprivation could be as dangerous as driving a car while intoxicated"". Why is it implied, if it is stated clearly in his lecture? My answer was ""People could fall asleep no matter what they are doing."" which is implied from his examples about dangers of sleep deprivations. That was wrong according to the answers.",interrogative

"Hello everyone.  First of all, thank you TST Prep for providing these practice listening questions.  Second, here is some advice if you are having trouble with the listening portion of the test:  I suggest you practice this with any English-speaking videos.  Listen to the video at 1.5 times speed.  It will be hard for you. Then immediately listen to it a second time at 1.75 times speed.  It will be very hard.  Then listen to it at 2.0 times speed.  Try your best-- maybe you will only be able to get a few words.  Finally, listen to it at 1.25 times the speed.  Suddenly it will seem very slow and you will be able to understand a lot of it--- but you are now actually listening to English 25% faster than normal!  Practice this on any English videos a half hour a day for two weeks.  You will be amazed at how much better you get! When you listen to the actual TOEFL at normal English speed it will seem so easy.  This trick works for any foreigh language, by the way. (I think the audio clips you use should be between 2 and 5 minutes long.  You want to be able to remember what you just heard.  My best guess is that longer videos will make this more difficult.)",positive

Sure, Spanish maybe part of the Linguistics Dept but it maybe a different faculty or institute for all we know. How on Earth is someone supposed to guess anything like that? The fact that there's a an answer like B which specifically mentions "" Spanish dept"" makes it even more confusing and led me to believe that this was the correct answer since the professor talks about it several times ""it's been ages since anyone who wasn't. Spanish major was able to go there"", and ""the spanish dept is pretty adamant about this"". Would appreciate your thoughts.",interrogative

In the video, the answer is formulated as ""Linguistics major"" and in the material as ""Spanish major"". I was doing the test while watching your video, so I eliminated A) immediately because linguistics is not Spanish. Then I choose B) as the next best choice and made a mistake, but I would have chosen A) if it had been formulated as ""Spanish major"".

I would repeat -in my head- a word or two of what was just said throughout the listening section. I continued to do this about everything that was said and then answered the questions quickly. I found, that in the listening section the questions and answers were straight forward and relatively easy. I was amazed at how great it worked for me. If you like to take notes, that's fine, however, for me, it felt that it took away from active listening. So I would recommend, if you are prepping for this test right now, try it once and see how you do. Thanks again to Josh MacPherson!",positive

A linguistic major can refer to any language, but it is clearly stated that she probably isn't allowed to go because the Spanish department is in charge of this decision. I am an English linguistic major but I still wouldn't be allowed to go to Guatemala because I don't have any Spanish classes...based on this, 3a (she is not a linguistic major) is too vague to be the right answer in my opinion. Can someone explain?  I also find that 3 a and c in the third block could be both correct. People often ask questions by including the answer in order to a) confirm that they understood the task and b) to make the professor repeat his expectations again so that the person asking can be a 100% sure that what she way saying was right. I really struggle with those kind of questions because to me it says nothing about your English skills but rather tests your ability to interpret these questions in the same way TOEFL does.

If the answer were the option 1, it should’ve been Language not linguistics, I guess...

"To be honest this exam does not size up any of the actual listening abilities.. (you know we all understand every word) so the trick is obviously *not to assess what you heard, but what it might imply* this is why you might find up to even 3 true answers per question, plus the ridiculous amount of little time to pick an aswer.. maybe this ETS TOEFL  business rejects the fact that almost everyone would get quite the max punctuations if the test was logic and utterly a *listening* exam. No surprise even natives fail and find this exercise frustrating..!  Come on teachers, it's only english.. even dogs understand it, what is the purpose of making it complicated..??",negative

"Hey, I have been attracted to pursue a top deferred MBA at this point in life (2nd year, undergrad, 5-year dual degree program - MBA(tech) + BTech, NMIMS), and I reached out to a GSB alum for some clarity who encouraged me to think about the ""why MBA?"" Even though I feel I can predict this trajectory of doing an MBA for the future, I feel stumped with this question. It could either be that my reasons are based on my assumption of how I feel my current program won't do me well, or they are simply status seeking.  I've been going in circles for quite some time now with this process. Even though I still feel strongly about how an MBA would be very helpful to me, I am still trying to understand the ""need"" of it that I feel at this point in life. Are there some steps that you could recommend for some clarity? PS - I don't think any deferred MBA applicant would think of applying without some amount of prediction.",miscellaneous

Food = 5000$ a year. Clothes, materials, internet, subscription and what not 10000$ a year.  Visa complexities, permits to travel from one state to the other. At least 5-6 years of experience mostly hiring students who are well above 30. And average package 100000$ GMAT 500$ with international level competition with even less preference to Indian students. MBA in India Tution fee 220000 INR Food, clothes, internet, everything provided in campus by IIM. CAT Score 99 percentile. Average package 260000 INR.  Preference to Indian students. Middle class students when come to India of 30+ of age with over a crore of debt who don't even get employment in top firms. Damn I remember the article on HT times.

I have fully finished the 5lb Manhattan book, read through all Manhattan strategy guides and giving Manhattan mock tests (bought the 6 exams pack). After all this I got a 318 on my ets mock exam. I am learning words through flashcards I made on my own (includes 1100 Barron's and all 1000 words from the magoosh app). My vocabulary has gradually improved as I am able to notice the growth in daily life. My problem: I'm stuck at 164 quant and high 150s in verbal consistently. So much practice and no more growth in score. I have trouble recognizing my mistakes and I have realized my mistakes are more related to my personality. For example Reading quant questions fast and solving for something else even though i knew how to solve it and even not understanding some rc passages even after rereading the confusing sentences. I'm feeling I'm stuck and can't get out of this. I would be highly obliged if you could guide and use your experience to point out something wrong I'm doing. Thank you!",miscellaneous

"Those who ask ""Should I read the question first or the passage?"". My advice is - read the passage first. Why? Because if you read the question you will be focusing on finding the answer within the package throughout your read. The problem with that is that you will not be focusing on the passage itself, just on finding that one specific answer. Your brain will be not be retaining all details from the package, just the details specific to that one question... Yes this may help you increase your chances of answering ONE question correctly, but in my opinion it is not a viable strategy to answer ALL questions.",imperative
