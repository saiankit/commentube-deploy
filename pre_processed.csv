i am not sure if the description of categorical column is correct. if you are going to encode female a 0 and male a 1 you are introducing some relation between categories. or if you encode city you may end up with value 1 nyc 2 la 3 wa and it would mean that washington value is 3 time of nyc. i think how it is really done in the engine is that you introduce separate column for each category value. sor for sex you would get two columns: female and male with boolean values. if it is female then female column is equal 1 and male 0. you can do same with cities. if we have only three city then there would three extra column with boolean value indicating which city it was.,corrective

"although i can appreciate the amount of content in this video, i must point out for the beginner here that some of the explanation in the video are not correct. i am currently at 8 and so far i have noticed two main things: at 115 he explained that in linear regression in 3d space, assuming a linear relationship, you try to use two variable to predict the value of the third. this is true, but the model is then not a straight line pointing somewhere in 3d space, but a 2d plane. such false information give beginner a bad intuition for these things. furthermore, the whole titanic survival prediction section wa a classification task, so it had little to do with linear regression. he used the linearclassifier object, which (probably) run a logistic regression in the background. in the output dictionary, there were key that are typical for the output of a logistic regression. although linear regression and logistic regression are both algorithm that create model that assume a linear relationship between input variables, they are completely different algorithms. i would have liked to see a clear distinction between regression and classification problem here, because these are fundamental concept in ml and the video wrongly conveys that you solve a regression problem by predicting whether a passenger survives or not. edit: his intuitive explanation at 393 of what activation function do is just wrong. the sigmoid function doe not project the data point into higher dimensional space, quite the opposite, actually. the sigmoid function is defined a f: r n 0,1 , so it take a input an n dimensional vector and it yield a scalar (fancy word for a single number). this whole projection into higher dimensional space thing is known a the kernel trick and is not used in his examples, it is something completely different. activation function are used in neural network because they introduce non linearly which you need because otherwise your neural network would just be a linear classifier so it would basically do one big weighted summation of the inputs. this is not enough to capture complicated relationship in data. with non linearly introduced, it can be shown that a neural network can approximate any function with arbitrary accuracy, that is any function that might have generated the data. read up on the universal approximation theorem, if you want to learn more. edit 2: 365 you do not evaluate on your test data multiple time to select the best set of hyperparameters. that way, you overt your test data. a cleaner approach would be to split the data into three sets: the training set, the validation set and the test set. prior to training you define a few selection of hyperparameters you want to select the best from before you train all these model on the training data. you then evaluate the performance of each model on the validation data. finally, you select the best performing model and test it on the test data to get a final estimate of the model's performance on completely new data points. there are more sophisticated approach to do hyperparameter tuning but this is the basic idea.",corrective

(the reason is to make sure that student who are not serious are filtered out. will not change this requirement.) what you get: (almost!) free one on one total training with a native english teacher. (i will make sure i help you a best a i can.) what i get: a chance to learn and improve in teaching the total. i want to know that the student is truly serious about this, so, if interested, answer in the comments: 1. what is your motivation for taking the total? what goal will getting your desired total score help you achieve? 2. what are some of the biggest challenge that you are facing in preparing for the total? 3. what test score do you need to get on the total? 4. any more information you would like to share? i will choose one person to work with at first. maybe later i will choose another. we will talk about scheduling once i choose you. hope to hear from you. i will be posting on different videos.

with carrier discount it same price for s21 ultra 256gb and oplus 9 pro 256gb where i live. i get bud pro free with the galaxy phone while with oplus i get charger free. then i decided to replace my galaxy s9+ which is 3+ year old but work so fine that i just got bored that it just doe not get old. i trust samsung and also seeing bud pro free. s21 ultra became my choice. the presenter just forgot to mention about s pen support in galaxy s21 ultra. : ),corrective

"the camera on the s21u are sub par for the spec a do mark suggests with their forensic analysis. so, i suspect the op9p match or beat it. a for battery life, saying the s21u kill it, what is the proof? since the updates, i have seen 7h+ on the op9p and it now come very close to matching the s21u mah for mah! checking out speedtest g and it is clear the op9p beat out the expo s21u by a good margin, maybe a generational difference and even the win comfortably. it is clear the op9p is the best in performance. pricewise, the u market is not a good guide a in most other country the op9p fall between the s21 and s21+ in pricing and the s21u is 350 more retail so easy win for op9p. hard to buy the s21u without a big discount, but again that mainly happens in the u where samsung is trying to destroy the competition with deals. in the uk we get the odd flash sale but give it two month and the op9p will also get these discounts. so unless you are a hardcore samsung, the op9p is the def value choice out of the two.",miscellaneous
"i m using the 9 pro from over 2 week and i am absolutely loving it there wa a minimal heating issue but now it s almost gone with the third update in my unit and the phone run ultra smooth. battery life also increased with the update now and camera s improved overall no issue except these but they are gone with update so i m extremely happy buying the 9 pro. comparison to s21 ultra or iphone 12 pro with 9 pro (for u indians) is stupid a the 9 pro is 40k 45k (almost $750) cheaper then s21ultra or 55k ($900) cheap then iphone 12 pro, i could go and return from bangkok in that for s21 and south korea for iphone 12 pro",miscellaneous

i am on the fence with this because for similar spec ram and storage phone they are priced the same. i wanted to give samsung the flick but thinking maybe samsung is the way to go now because if you intend to keep the phone for 2 4 year then samsung is the clear choice due to availability of aftermarket accessory and support patches.,miscellaneous
